Main conclusions of the Communication:
While the Commission does share the conviction that animal testing should be phased out in Europe, its approach for achieving that objective differs from the one proposed in this Citizens' Initiative.
The Commission considers that the Directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (Directive 2010/63/EU), which the Initiative seeks to repeal, is the right legislation to achieve the underlying objectives of the Initiative. It sets full replacement of animals as its ultimate goal as soon as it is scientifically possibly, and provides a legally binding stepwise approach as non-animal alternatives become available. Therefore, no repeal of that legislation was proposed.
Moreover, the Communication sets out four further Commission’s actions to be taken towards the goal of phasing out animal testing. These actions included a scientific conference engaging the scientific community and relevant stakeholders in a debate on how to exploit the advances in science for the development of scientifically valid non-animal approaches.
The Commission commits to active monitoring of compliance and enforcement of the legislation, and will continue supporting the development and validation of alternative approaches to the use of animals in research and testing.

Main conclusions of the Communication:
On the first aim, to 'ban glyphosate-based herbicides', the Commission concluded that there are neither scientific nor legal grounds to justify a ban of glyphosate, and will not make a legislative proposal to that effect.
On the second aim, to “ensure that the scientific evaluation of pesticides for EU regulatory approval is based only on published studies, which are commissioned by competent public authorities instead of the pesticide industry”, the Commission committed to come forward with a legislative proposal by May 2018, amongst others, to strengthen the transparency of the EU risk assessment in the food chain and enhance – through a series of measures – the governance for the conduct of industry studies submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for risk assessment. See details below under ‘Follow-up’.
On the third aim, to 'set EU-wide mandatory reduction targets for pesticide use, with a view to achieving a pesticide-free future', the Commission concluded that it intends to focus on the implementation of the [Sustainable Use Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/sustainable_use_pesticides_en) Sustainable Use Directive , and will re-evaluate the situation, initially in a report to Council and the Parliament on the implementation of the Directive to be produced in 2019.

Main conclusions of the [Communication](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=C(2021)4747&lang=en) Communication :
In its response to the ECI, the Commission communicated its intention to table a legislative proposal, by the end of 2023, to phase out, and finally prohibit, the use of cages for all animals mentioned in the ECI, under conditions to be determined on the basis of opinions from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the results of an impact assessment and a public consultation.
In parallel to the legislation and to facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, the Commission will seek specific supporting measures in key related policy areas, such as trade and research and innovation. In particular, the new Common Agricultural Policy will provide financial support and incentives – such as the new eco-schemes instrument – to help farmers upgrade to more animal-friendly facilities in line with the new standards.

**Current Followup:**
On 30 June 2021, the Commission decided to positively respond to the ECI. [In its communication](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=C(2021)4747&lang=en) the Commission sets out plans for a legislative proposal to prohibit cages for the species and categories of animals covered by the ECI and to consider options for introducing rules or standards for imported products that are equivalent to the EU’s and/or a labelling requirement, in compliance with WTO rules. The Commission will also pursue or implement specific supporting measures in key related policy areas. The Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to complement the existing scientific evidence to determine the conditions needed for the prohibition of the use of cages. Scientific opinions were adopted by EFSA on the welfare on farm [of pigs](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2022.7421) (2022), [broilers,](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7788) addressing also broiler breeders (2022), [laying hens](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7789) , addressing also layer breeders and pullets (2022), [ducks, geese and quail](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7992) (2023) and of [calves](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7896) (2023). The Commission also has started a series of stakeholder consultations in 2022, including in the context of subgroups of the EU Animal Welfare Platform (on poultry, on ruminants and on pigs). To facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, in which the competitiveness of the sectors concerned is further improved, the Commission is pursuing supporting measures in key related policy areas, such as research and innovation.

The [proposal for a Nature Restoration Law](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:304:FIN) proposal for a Nature Restoration Law tabled in June 2022 combines an overarching restoration objective for the long-term recovery of nature in the EU’s land and sea areas with binding restoration targets for specific habitats and species.
In its reply, the Commission underlined that rather than proposing new legislative acts, the priority is to ensure thatthe proposals currently being negotiated by the co-legislators are timely adopted and then implemented, together with aneffective implementation of the CAP. Over one million statements in support of this citizens’ initiative are a clear signal and encouragement that the high level of ambition of the Commission proposals should be maintained.

The Commission commits to:
● Start without delay preparatory work with a view to launch, by the end of 2023, an impact assessment on the environmental, social and economic consequences of applying the “fins naturally attached” policy to the placing on the EU market of sharks, whether within the EU or for international trade (imports and exports).
● By end 2024, provide more detailed EU’s import and export information to improve statistics on trade in shark products.
● Better enforce the EU’s already strong traceability measures by strengthening the enforcement of EU law that applies to the entire value chain - control of fishing at sea, full traceability of shark products from landing to consumer, consumer information, and prevention and redress of illegal trade - and ensuring the collection and reporting of complete and reliable information by fishermen and Member States’ authorities on all these aspects.
● Step up the EU’s international action: advocate for a worldwide ban of shark finning and strengthen the effective implementation of conservation and management measures for sharks’ species; encourage the reduction of demand for shark fins; and fight against shark fins trafficking.

The Commission has tasked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide a scientific opinion on the welfare of animals farmed for fur.
Building further on this scientific input, and on an assessment of economic and social impacts, the Commission will then communicate, by March 2026, on the most appropriate action. The Commission will also continue its preparatory work on other animal welfare proposals, as announced in the Farm to Fork Strategy.
The Commission has also proposed accompanying actions in the field of 'One Health' preventive mechanisms, invasive alien species and labelling of fur in apparel and clothing accessories.
