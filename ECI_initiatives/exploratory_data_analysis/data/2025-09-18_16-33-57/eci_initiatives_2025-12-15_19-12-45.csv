2012/000001,Fraternité 2020 - Mobility. Progress. Europe.,"F2020 wants to enhance EU exchange programmes – like Erasmus or the European Voluntary Service (EVS) – in order to contribute to a united Europe based on solidarity among citizens.
               
               F2020 suggests three measures to increase mobility: 1) The Commission shall use existing EU funds more consistently to encourage mobility. Also, it shall promote more funds for exchange programmes in the future. Eventually, 10 percent of the EU budget shall be used on these programmes. 2) Increased efforts shall be made for participants to develop intercultural skills, e.g. by offering language classes and classes about the host country's traditions, history, society etc. 3) Progress in the field of mobility shall be better monitored e.g. through Eurostat or Eurobarometer surveys.",,Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2012/000001_en,09/05/2012,09/05/2012,01/11/2013,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""09/05/2012""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""09/05/2012""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""01/11/2013""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""01/11/2013""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","7,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Allianz Kulturstiftung (https://kulturstiftung.allianz.de/)"",""date"":""21/03/2013"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Fondation Hippocrène (www.fondationhippocrene.eu)"",""date"":""21/02/2013"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Government to You (www.Gov2u.org)"",""date"":""05/09/2012"",""amount_in_eur"":""2,593""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""École Supérieure des Sciences Commerciales d’Angers (www.ESSCA.fr)"",""date"":""12/11/2012"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Government to You (www.Gov2u.org)"",""date"":""05/09/2012"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,777""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Government to You (www.Gov2u.org)"",""date"":""05/09/2012"",""amount_in_eur"":""630""}]",,,,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:34.428602,2025-12-15T19:12:34.430988

               EU is a major player in the exploitation of sharks and as inspections at sea are scarce fins are still illegally retained, transshipped, or landed in EU.

2020/000002,"VOTERS WITHOUT BORDERS, Full Political Rights for EU Citizens","Subject-matter.
               



                We demand reforms to strengthen the existing rights of EU citizens to vote and stand in European and municipal elections in their country of residence and new legislation to extend them to regional, national elections and referenda.
                


                Main objectives.
                


                •   Remove barriers to registration of EU citizens to vote and stand in European and local elections either in their country of residence or origin.
               

                •   Reaffirm Universal Suffrage as a fundamental right and value. EU citizens should have the right to choose whether to vote in their country of residence or origin for all elections and referenda.
               

                •   Research the impact of such genuine Europeanization of voting rights, the necessary safeguards, and how they could include third-country nationals.
                


                These reforms remove a stain on European democracy and create a space for transnational politics.","Europe, WE have a problem! Existing rights to vote and stand as candidates in local and European elections are not working and -we believe- will not do so until EU citizens on the move have full political rights. The number of EU citizens living and working in other Member States of the EU has doubled in the last ten years, reaching 17 million people. Of this 17 million, less than 10% on average register in their country of residence and an unknown number (the EP does not aggregate this data and many states do not even make it public), go back to their country of origin to vote. All the signs are that with 73% of people recognising, according to Eurobarometer surveys, that they feel -to different extents- European, the number of mobile citizens will increase in the future. Freedom of movement is seen as the most outstanding of the EU’s achievements. The problem is that democratic participation is still seen through national eyes and has not caught up with increasing transnational mobility. People living in another Member States other than their own often feel unrepresented in politics. Firstly, there are still many barriers and obstacles in the exercise of voting rights of EU citizens residing in a different Member State, coupled with the recent worrying developments of electoral irregularities in some Member States. Secondly, the low turnout of mobile EU citizens in local and European elections is not surprising, since they are still only given the right to vote in municipal and European elections in their country of residence but are excluded from the elections and democratic choices which really count. They are therefore still made to feel more like foreigners than full members of the community. As long as only national citizens can vote for national parties, parties are inclined to respond only to the interests of this national electorate, and this often pays off with political parties highlighting national populists’ messages and threats from “the external others”. But responsible policies mean keeping up with the increasing transnational flow and interdependencies, by ensuring that all European citizens can be equally represented in the decision-making process. European citizens are becoming increasingly conscious of the need to be better represented and make their voice heard in a more divided and politically unpredictable Europe. For this, they need to be recognized as equal and have full political rights. This ECI is value-driven and aims: I.   TO MAKE EUROPEAN CITIZENSHIP A REAL CITIZENSHIP Political rights are the defining feature of any citizenship and the means by which other rights can be represented and extended. Leaving an increasing number of people with only partial political rights is inconsistent not only with the popularity of this transnational citizenship, but also with the substance it has developed as a result of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU, and the fact European Citizenship is being strengthened by the recognition of professional qualifications and access to social security entitlements in one’s country of residence. EU citizenship has developed beyond its economic origins and free movement of labour to cover all categories of the population so that EU citizens should no longer be considered just as guest workers but as full and equal members of society. II.   TO TAKE A STEP TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE EU citizens like other migrants are for the most part in work contributing with their taxes, sending their children to the same schools and using the same services, as their national neighbours. Giving them full political rights would be consistent with the ban under EU Law of any discrimination on the grounds of nationality and the principles of ""No Taxation Without Representation"", and ""One Person, One Vote"".  It is illogical that European citizens can vote and stand in local elections but not in the regional ones which concern many of the same public services which impact on everyday life. They can elect members of the European Parliament from the city where they live but not the government that participates in the Council of Ministers, where many would argue the real power lies. III.   TO ENCOURAGE BETTER INTEGRATION Granting people full political rights where they live can help favour their integration in society. The political differentiation between EU and national citizens gives the wrong signal to policies of integration and does nothing either to help tackle the integration of migrants and refugees from outside the EU in European society. The wider aim of scaling up and equalising political rights for all legally resident migrant communities goes beyond what is legally possible for this initiative. This ECI should nevertheless be seen as a step towards that aim, in order to avoid discrimination between EU citizens and third-country nationals. IV.   TO HELP BUILD A TRANSNATIONAL EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY This initiative addresses the fundamental issue of how to ensure that effective electoral rights are made compatible with freedom of movement. Building on the record turnout in the 2019 European elections, the Commission does recognise the need to give European citizens a stronger role in decision-making and is asking them to take on a role as a third party alongside civil society and the EU institutions in the Conference on the Future of Europe. The conference will consider the system of lead candidates and how to introduce transnational lists for elections to the European Parliament is recognised. Such reforms should go hand in hand with concerns that everyone always has the chance to vote in the first place. To sum up: this ECI demands that the Commission should reform legislation on existing rights, extend them to regional, national elections and referenda, whilst researching the wider impact of full political rights for EU citizens without creating discrimination against third-country nationals.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2020/000002_en,04/03/2020,31/08/2020,11/06/2022,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""04/03/2020""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""31/08/2020""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""11/06/2022""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""13/06/2022""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":2},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","79,676.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""ECIT Foundation"",""date"":""01/05/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Université Libre de Bruxelles"",""date"":""07/01/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Visit.Brussels ASBL"",""date"":""12/01/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,186""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (2020 Cooperation Agreement)"",""date"":""20/10/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""15,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (2022 Cooperation Agreement)"",""date"":""11/03/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""7,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (2021 Cooperation Agreement)"",""date"":""01/04/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""49,990""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ECIT Foundation"",""date"":""01/01/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ECIT Foundation"",""date"":""01/05/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""5,000""}]","8,780","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""275"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""2.05%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""325"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""2.20%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""85"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.71%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""328"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""3.88%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""25"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.59%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""201"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.36%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""357"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""3.62%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""12"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""101"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.02%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,003"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""1.80%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,604"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""2.37%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""150"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.01%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""177"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.20%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""563"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""6.14%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,146"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""2.14%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""46"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.82%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""39"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.50%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""58"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""1.37%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""41"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.97%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""598"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""2.92%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""183"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.50%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""270"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.82%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""276"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""1.19%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""95"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.96%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""141"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""2.50%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""547"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""1.32%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""134"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.91%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:40.572880,2025-12-15T19:12:40.574253

2020/000004,Freedom to share,"To legalise sharing – via digital networks, for personal use and non-profit purposes – of files containing works and other material protected by copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights, with a view to striking a balance between the rights of authors and other rightholders and the universal right to science and culture.","This initiative calls for the adoption of a legislative act providing for a waiver of copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights for natural persons sharing files via digital networks for personal use and non-profit purposes. File-sharing came into existence in 1999, with the advent of Napster. Over the years, technology has made distributed (or peer-to-peer) file sharing ever more efficient (e.g. Gnutella, Freenet, BitTorrent). From the outset, the main rightholder companies have opposed the use of sharing technologies for works and other material subject to copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights and current legislation is broadly in line with their wishes. However, one question remains: is it fair for copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights to prevent the sharing of works and other material? Copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights should help towards fostering the dissemination of culture, innovation and social progress. Current legislation bans the sharing of files containing works and other material subject to copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights and seriously curtails the freedom of access to science and culture enshrined in Article 27(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This issue is of even greater relevance today, since the adoption of Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market. The Directive has a contradictory effect. On the one hand, Article 17 makes it easier for online content sharing service providers to obtain authorisation to disseminate protected content, thereby facilitating their role as privileged intermediaries and encouraging their practices of technical control and citizen profiling. On the other hand, file sharing remains banned. This initiative calls for citizens to be allowed to share files directly via peer-to-peer networks in order for them to have access to science and culture without being subject to checks and profiling. EU legislation enabling this would be perfectly compatible with international law if rightholders were given fair compensation. People and fundamental rights should be placed at the heart of political and legislative decisions. It is therefore necessary to change the current rules governing the sharing of files containing works and other material protected by copyright, related rights and sui generis database rights in order to enable the potential for freedom and social, cultural and economic development offered by digital networks.",Withdrawn,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2020/000004_en,15/05/2020,15/11/2020,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""15/05/2020""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""15/11/2020""},{""step"":""Withdrawn"",""date"":""23/06/2022""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Italy"":1}}","{""name"":""Associazione GOIPE"",""country_of_residence"":""Italy""}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":2},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","19,100.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Fix the Status Quo"",""date"":""13/09/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""13,100""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Piratenpartei Hessen"",""date"":""16/11/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""European Pirate Party"",""date"":""01/01/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Piratenpartei Deutschland"",""date"":""25/02/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""2,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Pirate Parties International"",""date"":""05/08/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Wikimedia Italia"",""date"":""29/07/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Associazione Partito Pirata"",""date"":""01/01/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,000""}]","2,248","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""55"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""52"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.35%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""25"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""21"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.25%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.31%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""84"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.57%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""25"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.25%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""46"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.47%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""149"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""353"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.52%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""50"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""37"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.25%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""18"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.20%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""303"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.57%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""14"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.26%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""173"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.85%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""54"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.15%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""53"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.36%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""53"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.23%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""26"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.26%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""58"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""1.03%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""321"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.77%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""220"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.49%""}}",0,,Withdrawn,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:40.735993,2025-12-15T19:12:40.737298

2021/000001,Civil society initiative for a ban on biometric mass surveillance practices,"We call on the European Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric technologies in order to avoid undue interference with fundamental rights.
               
               In particular, we ask the Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass surveillance. These intrusive systems must not be developed, deployed (even on a trial basis) or used by public or private entities insofar as they can lead to unnecessary or disproportionate interference with people’s fundamental rights.
               
               Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest and not to be discriminated against. The widespread use of biometric surveillance, profiling and prediction is a threat to the rule of law and our most basic freedoms.
               
               In this ECI, we therefore urge the ","Subject: Under EU data protection law, biometric data are especially sensitive and their processing is forbidden except where there is a “substantial public interest“, subject to strict necessity and proportionality requirements. According to a survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency, 83% of Europeans are against sharing their face data with authorities and 94% against sharing it with private entities. Still, biometric data are increasingly used by national and EU law enforcement, public authorities and private entities for identification or profiling of people in public spaces. The indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted use of such technologies constitutes biometric mass surveillance. It poses an inherently unnecessary and disproportionate interference in a wide range of fundamental rights including privacy and data protection, and can have a ‘chilling effect‘ on basic freedoms such as expression and assembly. Profiling based on the processing of such data can result in severe violations of the right to non-discrimination, and uses which claim to predict emotions or behaviour have no reliable scientific foundation. The EDPS has raised serious fundamental rights concerns about such technologies, calling to halt “automated recognition in public spaces of human features, not only of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals”. Objectives: Our ECI calls on the Commission to permanently end indiscriminate and arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometric data in ways which can lead to mass surveillance or any undue interference with fundamental rights. The existing EU legal framework, as it derives in particular from the GDPR and LED, clarifies that the use of biometric data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary with regards to a legitimate aim pursued, subject to the principle of proportionality. However, such general principles are subject to broad exceptions. The limited safeguards provided for by existing EU rules in their application have neither ensured transparency of biometric data processing nor prevented uses that constitute inherently disproportionate mass surveillance. Furthermore, the LED’s general principles allow Member States the discretion to permit, in national law, uses of biometrics which lead to mass surveillance. This use case is in stark contradiction to Member States’ obligations under EU data protection law and national constitutional protections for fundamental rights. The EU must use its powers to prevent the transformation of all people into potential suspects subject to seamless public biometric surveillance, which undermines principles of the rule of law and purpose limitation. It must stop the abuse of biometric data which leads to undue interference with fundamental rights and freedoms. This is key to ensure that European digital sovereignty is truly human-centric. We urge the Commission to remedy these unlawful practices by ensuring that, based on and in full respect for the general safeguards in the GDPR and LED, EU law explicitly and specifically prohibits biometric identification, profiling and related processing or capture, in public or publicly-accessible spaces (including online), on the grounds that this leads to inherently unnecessary and disproportionate mass surveillance. The public consultation on the upcoming EU legislative initiative on AI demonstrated that there is public support for stricter regulations on uses of biometric technologies. This attention has also revealed the need for a targeted legislative proposal to ensure that Europeans’ rights are sufficiently safeguarded from biometric mass surveillance. Background: Many deployments of biometric surveillance in the EU have been carried out without evidence of prior DPIAs, necessity and proportionality assessments or other safeguards, despite the high potential for unlawful mass surveillance and other fundamental rights abuses. National courts and DPAs have already struck down individual deployments, but we need systematic action to ensure regulatory certainty. Given the lack of awareness of the risks, the lack of transparency in EU deployments and the difficulty of enforcing the GDPR and LED‘s general principles, national courts and DPAs will benefit from increased legal certainty on the impermissible uses of biometric technology. Not acting risks normalising biometric mass surveillance and allowing the legalisation of national deployments for purposes which are incompatible with fundamental rights. The Commission thus faces a strong impetus to act. The Commission’s AI White Paper envisaged that, due to the risk of fundamental rights breaches, remote biometric identification should on principle be considered “high risk” and be conditional upon mandatory conformity assessments. The paper failed to fully examine the impact of such applications on fundamental rights: had it done so, we believe the only conclusion could have been that such uses ought to be considered disproportionate. A legal act will even better protect fundamental rights if: It is accompanied by implementation guidance to Member States to prevent national discretion on uses that unduly restrict fundamental rights, and provide strict safeguards for all other uses in accordance with the GDPR and LED; The Commission ceases funding for research/development of biometric mass surveillance technologies, including for profiling, behavioural or emotional prediction; Member States must notify and disclose the use of any such technology to their DPA for prior assessment of legality and proportionality; The AIHLEG ‘Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI’ are encoded as the legal basis for regulating the funding of biometric technologies.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2021/000001_en,07/01/2021,17/02/2021,01/08/2022,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""07/01/2021""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""17/02/2021""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""01/08/2022""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""24/10/2022""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":1},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","46,786.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""European Digital Rights (EDRi)"",""date"":""28/10/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""8,663""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""European Digital Rights (EDRi)"",""date"":""31/03/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""8,393""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Digitalcourage"",""date"":""01/02/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""2,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""European Digital Rights (EDRi)"",""date"":""21/12/2020"",""amount_in_eur"":""10,393""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""European Digital Rights (EDRi)"",""date"":""01/06/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""13,840""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""European Digital Rights (EDRi)"",""date"":""01/08/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""3,497""}]","78,092","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,303"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""17.19%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,505"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""10.17%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""182"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""1.52%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""317"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""3.75%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""50"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""1.18%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""695"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""4.69%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,136"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""11.51%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""91"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""1.84%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""372"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""3.77%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""14,229"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""25.55%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""37,621"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""55.59%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""817"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""5.52%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""203"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.37%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""405"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""4.42%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,087"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""7.63%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""62"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""1.10%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""260"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""3.35%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""171"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""4.04%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""34"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.80%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""5,732"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""28.04%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""692"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""1.89%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""971"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""6.56%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,768"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""7.60%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""273"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""2.77%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,813"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""32.15%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,642"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""3.95%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""661"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""4.46%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:40.904192,2025-12-15T19:12:40.905612
2021/000002,Civil Servant Exchange Program (CSEP),"As European students and future civil servants, we believe that exchanges should not stop once studies come to an end.
               




                We therefore propose the creation of a Civil Servant Exchange Program (CSEP), an exchange and training programme between civil servants of the Member States of the European Union. The aim of this ‘Erasmus for the civil service’ would be to offer civil servants from EU Member States professional experience in a similar service in another Member State for a period of 2 to 12 months. During the exchange, civil servants could continue to receive the salary of their home country, subject to compensation from the EU if this salary is lower than that received in the host country for an equivalent position.
               

                The CSEP would strengthen the freedom of movement of workers in the EU, foster an exchange of best practices between civil services and improve links between Member States. In addition, the CSEP would help civil servants to overcome the numerous challenges they encounter in their working relations with t","The EU is also a union of European peoples and we believe that it should be lived first-hand by more people. We would like the workers who play a key role in its Member States, i.e. civil servants (teachers, hospital staff, prison staff, judges, police officers, administrative staff, etc.), to also benefit from the European experience through this programme. The Civil Servant Exchange Program would offer the EU and its Member States several benefits: 1. Benefits of a European experience The aim of the programme is to enable all civil servants, irrespective of their place in the hierarchy or their field of activity, to reap the benefits of a European experience. The establishment of a European exchange framework for national civil servants would give them the opportunity to meet their European counterparts and experience life abroad. We believe that such an exchange would forge links between Europeans and thus foster mutual understanding. It would also be an opportunity for them to travel, discover new cultures and have intense and enriching experiences. Career progression in the civil service does not always allow for professional experience abroad, unlike for private-sector employees. Thanks to the CESP, the civil service will be able to offer European experiences to its civil servants, which will improve their autonomy and adaptability. This would make employment in the civil service more appealing. 2. Development of additional skills and exchange of best practices The exchange will enable civil servants to practise foreign languages, develop skills in an international environment and learn other forms of public management. Above all, it will be an opportunity for civil servants to exchange current practices from their national civil service and learn new ones. They will then be able to use the practices learned during the exchange back in their home country. These practices may include new forms of administrative or healthcare organisation, or a particular teaching method for civil servants working in the field of national education. In addition, this programme will provide an opportunity for civil servants to see the impact of different public responses to issues that are common to many national civil services. While exchanges and the coordination of best practices are encouraged in the EU through the Open Method of Coordination, the CSEP will allow civil servants to directly try out and exchange best practices on the ground, thus establishing a ‘direct method of coordination’ through long-term practice. 3. Strengthening the EU and its Member States As we are determined to pursue the project of an 'ever closer union’ among the peoples of Europe, we propose the establishment of the CSEP to strengthen the link between national civil services and citizens. We believe that the more citizens are able to move within the EU, the better they understand the different countries that make up the EU. The civil service is one of the biggest sectors of employment in each Member State. However, it offers few opportunities to work in an international environment. We want to develop contacts between workers who are involved in running the Member States, so that they can also benefit from a European experience. Thanks to the programme, a whole category of workers will be able to move within the EU. Thus, the establishment of the CSEP will help improve the functioning of the internal market and strengthen freedom of movement for workers. The programme will also enhance decision-making at European level through exchanges between civil services and make it easier for them to cooperate with each other, thus enabling them to better identify common problems. Since any decision by one Member State inevitably affects the others, national administrations must become better acquainted and understand each other to ensure that they share the same values and are thus able to run their countries together democratically. We believe that bringing national administrations closer will undoubtedly facilitate European decision-making. The CSEP is a further step towards a Europe that shares and promotes common values. Establishment of the CSEP by the European Union and its Member States: The role of the EU in establishing the CSEP will be to develop a common European legislative framework. It will allow Member States to freely and voluntarily offer positions in their civil service for civil servants on exchange. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and the respective competences of the EU and its Member States, national administrations may limit access to this programme to certain positions in order to maintain public order and safeguard the security of important national public information. As regards the remuneration of civil servants, we are in favour of the idea that, during the exchange, civil servants will continue to receive their salary from their home country. An EU compensation mechanism should be provided for in cases where the salary received by civil servants on exchange is lower than that received in the host country for an equivalent position. The European Social Fund could be the institution responsible for offsetting differences in salaries (Article 3(1)(a)(vii) of Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013). Additional financial support from the EU or Member States may be considered depending on the specific situation.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2021/000002_en,21/04/2021,04/10/2021,04/10/2022,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""21/04/2021""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""04/10/2021""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""04/10/2022""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""28/10/2022""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""France"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,"1,643","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""37"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.28%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""41"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.28%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""43"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.36%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""52"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.61%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.17%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""71"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.48%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.08%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.17%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""369"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""194"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.29%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""56"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.38%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""22"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.15%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""230"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""2.51%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""145"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""3"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.07%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""21"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""41"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.11%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""98"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""29"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.16%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""112"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""12"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.08%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:40.993071,2025-12-15T19:12:40.994512
2021/000003,Green Garden Roof Tops,"In Europe there are many existing stores with an empty rooftop; in most of the cases these rooftops are not being used for any specific purpose. In addition, these rooftops are full of plastic and stones, materials of which the roof is made of. Therefore, these areas are in itself not contributing to the benefits of the environment, rather they are simply increasing the environmental damages. The reason of focusing on the environmental benefits, is stemming from our current time environmental crisis. We need to rethink and find ways to increase the awareness of environmental problems and how to bring our society, the economy and the protection of our planet in a healthy balance. Therefore, the core of the plan is to utilize the existing spaces found on rooftops.  The idea is to create on different corporations’ rooftops a green garden area.

2021/000004,Ban Fossil Fuel Advertising and Sponsorships,"We call on the European Commission to propose an EU legislative act: prohibiting advertisements for fossil fuels, as well as air, road and water-borne transportation (other than transport services of general economic interest) powered by fossil fuels; prohibiting advertisements  from any undertakings active in the market for fossil fuels, in particular by extracting, refining, supplying, distributing or selling fossil fuels; prohibiting sponsorships by undertakings defined under point 2 above, or using trademarks or commercial names used for fossil fuels. This law would fall into the EU competence, in that it would consist in an internal market regulation aimed at enhancing consumer protection, as well as a high level of public health and environmental protection. Indeed, this legislation would increase public awareness of products and technologies that are responsible for climate change and other environmental and health harms. As such, it would pursue objectives that are envisaged by the EU environmental and consumer protection policies, via the harmonisation of rules on fossil fue","Our European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) aims to achieve a ban on any fossil fuel advertising or sponsorship. Specifically, our ECI calls on the Europe Commission to propose to members states: A ban on any promotion or advertising, direct or indirect, as well as any free or promotional distribution, or any sponsorship relationship: a.   for any and all companies and associated sub brands or lobbying organisations that extract, refine, produce, supply, distribute, or sell any fossil fuels b.   for any companies that promote the use of any fossil fuel powered air, road or maritime vehicles operating from fossil fuels, with the exception of vehicles dedicated to transport services of general economic interest c.   of any fossil fuel products including oil, fossil gas, and coal This would include a ban of the above products and companies ability to advertise and sponsor in the following areas: ●   Offline: any advertisements in print media, television, billboard, radio, SRI, or academic publications ●   Online: any social media ads or branded content on all social or traditional media platforms ●   Sport- any sponsorship of sports clubs or events ●   Culture- any sponsorship of museums, arts institutions, theatres, music venues, festivals, events or artists ●   Education- public universities, schools, or any public educational institution ●   Science: any public science festivals or funding for public scientific institutes and educational publications ●   Public events- in particular related to climate, health, biodiversity, environment and ecological sustainability. ●   Third party media events Why? 1.   Fossil fuels are perpetuating the climate crisis, and should not be advertised The advertisement of climate damaging products and intentional subsequent uplift in sales has a negative impact on an increase of greenhouse gas emissions which we cannot afford. For example, the New Weather Institute think tank found in a case study into a singular Audi advertising campaign, there was an uplift of sales driven by the advertising of up to 132,700 cars, which multiplied with the carbon footprint sold per item resulted in an overall increase of greenhouse gas emissions of 5,175,300 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent due to  a singular advertising campaign. 2.   Fossil fuels have created a public health crisis, and should not be advertised Air pollution is currently killing more people than smoking  and most of the particulate matter and other air pollutants in Europe come from the burning of fossil fuels. When fossil fuels are killing people via air pollution and other means, why is it still socially acceptable or legal to have the same brands responsible for sponsoring our public institutions, and having access to our advertising spaces? If tobacco advertising and sponsorship are banned on the basis of public health, then why are we not aiming for a European wide ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships much like the EU tobacco advertising and sponsorship ban of 2003/4. 3.   Fossil fuel companies are misleading consumers, and some have been found to be breaking advertising guidelines. Some fossil fuel companies are being legally challenged for their advertisements because their advertising campaigns tend to overemphasize renewable products and misrepresent their actual investment into renewable technologies. For example last year ClientEarth filed a legal complaint using OECD guidelines against BP for misleading consumers into thinking they were a renewables company, when they in fact spend 96% of their total investment on oil and gas. In legal terms many of these advertisements could be challenged, but the EU should be taking proactive steps to remove this threat preemptively by creating legislation to prevent this. 4.   Fossil fuel sponsorships are being used for political access In 2016  this Unearthed investigation found that BP used their sponsorship deal with the British Museum and a specific 'Day of the Dead' exhibition to further their oil plans in Mexico and Australia. FOI requests revealed that BP sought to access Mexican and UK government figures at a private event by the British Museum as part of the BP-sponsored Days of the Dead festival, just one month before bidding opened for new deepwater drilling permits controlled by the Mexican government.

2021/000005,European EcoScore,"We are a citizens’ movement driven by young people from all over Europe who want to take concrete action for our environment!
               
               In view of the ambitions of the Green Deal for Europe and the Paris Agreement, we call on the European Commission to impose a reliable ""European EcoScore"". It consists of a label providing European consumers with transparent information about the environmental impact of products manufactured or sold on the European Union market.
               
               This compulsory and clearly visible indication on the packaging would provide simple and reliable information on the environmental impact of the product according to the letter selected (“A” = very environmentally friendly, while ""F"" = very harmful to the environment).
               

               Objectives:
               
               • To enable European consumers to make informed choices that take into account the environmental impact of the products on offer, based on a clear and reliable indication.
               
               • To encourage professionals to r","Our project in a nutshell: We lead a European citizens' initiative that aims to introduce a European EcoScore, i.e. an indication of the environmental impact of products manufactured and sold on the European market. The EcoScore would be indicated visually on the product packaging in the main field of vision, to bring more transparency on the environmental impact of those products. Our highest ambition is to have it displayed on all types of products. However, we are conscious that at the present time it is difficult to calculate it for complex products. Therefore, we consider that developing it primarily on food and clothe items is a good start! Current observations: • The European Union is taking proactive measures aimed at combating climate change (Green Deal and Climate Law). It is essential to support it and to move from declarations to action! • An increasing number of consumers want clear and transparent information about the products they buy. The success of applications such as Yuka,  which indicates the nutritional quality of food products (more than 20 million downloads), or the launch of similar labels - reporting the environmental impact of products - by different supermarkets or other applications (as Open-Food-Fact, Etiquettable, Eco-Score collective, …) indicates that such demand for information is growing. • The eco-score concept is developing. However, initiatives are private, which has several drawbacks: o There is no legal harmonization of the calculation methods of the different eco-scores. o The eco-scores’ initiators do not have all information needed to calculate the eco-score, as they depend on the goodwill of producers and companies. o Until now, most eco-scores developed are not directly indicated on the products but are only accessible through a scan from a specific application. How does our proposal respond to the observations made? • Our initiative contributes to the necessary awareness-raising of European consumers about the environmental impact of the products they buy, by providing them with a clear, reliable and transparent indication. • We are sending a clear signal to the European institutions about the importance of implementing measures that benefit the environment. • A European EcoScore helps to encourage professionals to reduce their environmental impact while highlighting products that are already environmentally friendly. • A European EcoScore offers a uniform indication based on an identical calculation process for the whole territory of the European Union, avoiding confusion for the consumer. • With the introduction of this mandatory official indication, professionals have to provide all the necessary information to calculate the European EcoScore. • Our initiative is federative: in these times of pandemic, young people in particular are looking for projects which bind them and allow them to feel involved in their future. Our ambition is to create a collective and proactive movement that affirms we are ""United in diversity"" and that transcends generations! How to determine the European EcoScore? This is a complex issue that needs to be discussed by experts. Let us recall that the purpose of a European Citizens' Initiative is to propose an idea to the European Commission, which can then take it into consideration and implement it concretely. Nevertheless, we have several suggestions. Firstly, it is useful to remind that several ‘eco-score’ proposed by private initiatives are already in use. There are therefore various databases (see Agribalyse) and methods that could reasonably be used to calculate such a score. The European EcoScore could be inspired by these actions. For instance, a system of bonus/malus points could be added to the calculation method to favour certain desirable characteristics of a product. Amongst other things, we think about the local and/or seasonal aspect of it, its impact on soils and water quality, the animal welfare, the award of the European organic farming label, ... Secondly, we believe that it would be interesting to use the product’s life cycle assessment (LCA method) - developed by the European Commission for more than 10 years - to calculate the European EcoScore. The LCA method is taking into accounts many important criteria needed to calculated the EcoScore, such as the extraction, transportation, packaging, utilization, etc. of the products. However, this scientific method is subject to criticism: to be applied to a large scale of products, it must be developed and simplified. We insist on the fact that the European EcoScore calculation method should be based on scientific evidence. As foreseen in the European treaties (article 114, §3 TFEU), the European Commission's proposals must take into account any new developments based on scientific facts. The method for determining the European EcoScore will thus have to evolve in line with new scientific knowledge and the upward evolution of minimum environmental standards. Additional request: We believe that detailed information about the European EcoScore of each product should be made easily available to consumers. We propose that a barcode on the product can be scanned directly to take the consumer to an online platform. This page would include an explanation of the European EcoScore calculation process, a reference to other labels obtained by the product (and recognised by the European Union), as well as details of the score obtained for each criteria.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2021/000005_en,30/06/2021,23/07/2021,23/07/2022,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""30/06/2021""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""23/07/2021""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""23/07/2022""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""17/02/2023""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":41},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","1,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Haute Ecole Louvain en Hainaut"",""date"":""17/04/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""750""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""WWF (Belgium)"",""date"":""21/02/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""250""}]","7,722","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""317"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""2.37%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,415"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""23.07%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""22"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""62"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.73%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""31"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""49"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.50%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.26%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""72"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.73%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""755"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""1.36%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""922"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""1.36%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""57"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.39%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""60"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""60"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.65%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""546"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""1.02%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""20"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.26%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""54"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""1.28%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""4"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""631"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""3.09%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""69"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.19%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""83"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.56%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""45"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.19%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""32"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.32%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""26"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.46%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""312"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.75%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""49"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.33%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:41.248214,2025-12-15T19:12:41.249554
2021/000006,SAVE CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS - COMMIT TO A EUROPE WITHOUT ANIMAL TESTING,"With the EU ban on cosmetics tests on animals came the promise of a Europe in which animals no longer suffer and die for the sake of cosmetics. That promise has been broken. Authorities still demand animal tests on ingredients used in cosmetics, which goes against the expectations and wishes of the public and the intention of legislators.
               




                Yet, never have we had such powerful non-animal tools for assuring safety or such a golden opportunity to revolutionise human and environmental protection. The European Commission must uphold and strengthen the ban and transition to animal-free safety assessment.
               



                We call on the European Commission to do the following:
               



                1. Protect and strengthen the cosmetics animal testing ban.
               

                Initiate legislative change to achieve consumer, worker, and environmental protection for all cosmetics ingredients without testing on animals for any purpose at any time.
               



                2. Transform EU chemicals regulat","The World-Leading EU Cosmetics Animal Testing and Marketing Bans We call on the European Commission to protect and strengthen the cosmetics animal testing ban. The wishes of citizens and legislators are clear: animals must not suffer and die for the sake of cosmetics. We maintain that new safety assessments for cosmetics ingredients imported into, manufactured in, or sold within the EU may only rely on non-animal data. As such, EU test requirements – including requirements set out in REACH – must not undermine the bans. Instead, a substance-tailored approach should be applied to ensure consumers, workers, and the environment are protected without further tests on animals. It is essential that the European Commission ensure proper implementation of the bans on animal testing for cosmetics and on marketing animal-tested products as originally intended and instigate legislative change to achieve this goal for both human health and environmental toxicity endpoints across all relevant sectors. To achieve the objective of protecting and strengthening the cosmetics animal testing ban, we urge the European Commission to ensure that the following mandates are met: • Immediately implement the existing EU bans on animal testing for cosmetics and the marketing of ingredients tested on animals as intended by legislators to ensure that only non-animal methods are used for the safety assessment of cosmetics ingredients. • Clarify that the requirement to rely on non-animal data for the safety assessment of cosmetics ingredients must be applied and animal data rejected, regardless of the location and purpose of animal tests conducted after the cut-off periods described in Article 18(2) of the EU Cosmetics Regulation. • Initiate legislation to strengthen and broaden the cosmetics testing bans to ensure that consumers, workers, and the environment are protected without new tests on animals. • Devise a robust testing strategy for cosmetics ingredients using only available non-animal assessment strategies so that the implementation of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability reflects the overwhelming support for strengthening – rather than weakening – the protection of animals in Europe. Transforming Chemicals Regulation We call on the European Commission to transform EU chemicals regulation. The European Green Deal introduces a worthy commitment to a toxic-free environment whilst also presenting a golden opportunity for modern and sustainable regulation of chemicals. With the right investment and careful design, the EU could use non-animal approaches to provide the best protection of human health and the environment without wasting resources on an over-burdened and unreliable system dependent on the suffering and death of animals. To achieve the objective of ensuring sustainable chemicals regulation with recourse to additional animal test requirements, we urge the Commission to ensure that, at a minimum, the following mandates are met: • Put in place concrete steps – with dedicated funding, ambitious timelines and cross-sectoral support – to develop, validate, and implement human-relevant, non-animal approaches to identifying toxic chemicals. • Ensure that the rapid uptake of non-animal New Approach Methodologies is aligned between the European agencies with administrative responsibility for chemicals, biocides, plant protection products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. • Ensure that test requirement deadlines are not applied at the expense of scientific rigour or human and environmental safety by allowing a default fallback to reliance on unreliable tests on animals. Modernising Science in the EU We call on the European Commission to modernise science in the EU. The EU is at a crossroads. Decision-makers can choose either to continue relying on archaic animal tests or to lead the world by fostering a new era of animal-free science. Seventy-two per cent of adults in EU member states agree  that the time is right for the EU to plot a roadmap – containing concrete, measurable targets with associated timelines – towards its final goal of ending animal tests. To achieve the objective of working towards a roadmap for the phase-out of all animal testing in the EU, we urge the Commission to ensure that, at a minimum, the following mandates are met: • Openly endorse the desirability of phasing out the use of animals in science and state the belief that this is achievable. To illustrate this commitment, prioritise a transition to non-animal approaches as an integral part of all EU research, innovation, and education initiatives, while also acknowledging that Directive 2010/63/EU does not in and of itself represent a roadmap towards full replacement. • Prioritise the development and validation of non-animal methods in the EU budget and new overarching policies such as the European Green Deal, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, and post-COVID recovery plans and redirect funding away from animal studies to alternatives. • Coordinate actions across the directorates-general and agencies responsible for aspects of research, regulatory testing, education, and funding with the involvement of all member states to achieve a strategic focus on the final goal of fully replacing the use of animals in scientific procedures. • Include in the legislative proposal ambitious and achievable science-based targets with regard to a reduction in numbers of animals used, investments in advanced non-animal models and infrastructures, education and training synergy, and regulatory acceptance of non-animal methods.",Answered

2021/000007,ReturnthePlastics: A Citizen’s Initiative to implement an EU-wide deposit-system to recycle plastic bottles,"With the #ReturnthePlastics European Citizen's Initiative, we request the European Commission: 1. To implement an EU-wide deposit-system to recycle plastic bottles 2. To incentivize all EU Member states that supermarkets (chains) which are selling plastic bottles to install reverse vending machines for recycling the plastic bottles after being purchased and used by the consumer 3. To make the plastic bottle producing companies pay plastic taxes for the recycling and deposit-system of the plastic bottles (under the principle that the polluter should pay)","Problem: What is the problem with plastics? When plastics are not recycled or collected, they can end up in landfills or waterways. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, for example, is an island of floating plastic in the Pacific Ocean between California and Hawaii. With 80.000 tons of plastic, it is currently 3 times the size of France and accumulating rapidly. When the tidal waves break the plastics into smaller pieces overtime, animals like fish eat it, which is how microplastics end up on our plates. Scientific studies estimate that any person ingests on average 5 grams worth of microplastics a week (the equivalent of a credit card) through food consumption. Recently microplastics were found in a human placenta. This shows that plastics do not only affect the natural environments and animals, but also humans. We need to address the plastic pollution problem at the source. Solution: What is our proposed solution? #Returntheplastics proposes deposit system to recycle bottles in supermarkets #Returntheplastics is an initiative with an innovative proposal: to recycle plastic bottles based on a 15 euro cents deposit fee for every plastic bottle purchase in the European Union. Once empty, the consumer can return the plastic bottle to a supermarket which has a reverse vending machine to collect bottles for recycling. When the consumer brings back the empty plastic bottle, the consumer receives the 15 euro cents deposit fee which can be spent again in the supermarket. On 3 July 2021 the EU Directive on single-use plastics entered into force, which bans the 10 most common single-use plastic items (such as plates, cutlery, straws) in all EU member states, through a law approved by the European Parliament. However, plastic bottles which are among the most commonly used plastic products (it is estimated that globally 1 million bottles a minute are bought) and take up to 500 years to decompose, are not included in the single-use plastics ban. Therefore, the #ReturnthePlastics European Citizen’s Initiative proposes an EU Directive for a deposit system to allow consumers to conveniently return their plastic bottles to the supermarkets where they were purchased, to close the loop on the materials used for producing the bottles. #ReturnthePlastics created a special logo that plastic PET-bottle producers can include on the label of the PET-bottles they produce. This logo indicates that a deposit of 15 euro cents will be paid with the purchase of the bottle by the consumer at the cashier. When scanning the barcode of the plastic bottle, the 15 euro cents deposit will automatically be added to the consumer’s bill, mentioning that this amount is the deposit fee for the plastic bottle purchase. Throughout the EU, there are many examples of effective recycling systems. In Germany there is a dual system to recycle plastic bottles, first through sorting waste and secondly through a deposit-system whereby consumers pay a deposit fee when purchasing plastic bottles in the supermarket and then getting a voucher to spend in the same supermarket when returning the bottle to the reverse vending machine at the entrance. In Rome, a metro ticket fee can be paid (partially) with plastic bottles through reverse vending machines. With #ReturnthePlastics we want to create a recycling system that can be implemented in supermarkets in every country as the start of a global solution to plastic pollution. Worldwide streets, landfills, oceans, forests, beaches are filled with plastic PET-bottles, which can take up to 450 years to decompose. This innovation will solve different issues all at once: the process of recycling requires less energy or raw materials than the production of entirely new bottles, plastic bottles will no longer be found as trash on the street but picked up instead and this system will create awareness about the environmental cost of the production of plastic on our planet. The goal of the is to have implemented the #ReturnthePlastics recycling system for plastic bottles in 5 EU member states by the Climate Conference COP26 from 1-12 November 2021 in Glasgow and later in all 26 EU member states. We hope to become a global movement of change for refusing, recycling and reducing plastic in a fight against plastic pollution.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2021/000007_en,13/08/2021,19/11/2021,19/11/2022,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""13/08/2021""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""19/11/2021""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""19/11/2022""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""27/02/2023""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Greece"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}",,,"5,961","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""386"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""2.88%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""718"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""4.85%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""57"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.48%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""39"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.46%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""72"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.49%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""73"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.74%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.16%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""187"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.89%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""843"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""1.51%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,826"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""2.70%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""79"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.53%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""87"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.59%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""62"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.68%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""496"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.93%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""18"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.32%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.40%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""14"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.33%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""169"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.83%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""145"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.40%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""98"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""68"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.29%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""32"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.32%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""43"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.76%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""307"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.74%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""97"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.66%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:41.479718,2025-12-15T19:12:41.480921

The initiative thus invites the Commission to submit a proposal for a legal act under the Common Commercial Policy which is general in nature and does not target a specific country or territory.",,Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2021/000008_en,08/09/2021,20/02/2022,20/02/2023,,,,"[{""step"":""Registration refused"",""date"":""04/09/2019""},{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""08/09/2021""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""20/02/2022""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""20/02/2023""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""24/02/2023""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","86,827.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Joy Hotels Ltd."",""date"":""28/12/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""10,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign"",""date"":""31/03/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Avaaz"",""date"":""29/11/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,100""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""PIPD"",""date"":""29/11/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""50,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Open Society Foundations"",""date"":""21/03/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""24,727""}]","277,717","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,979"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""29.71%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""20,440"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""138.06%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""232"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""1.94%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""343"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""4.05%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""284"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""6.71%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""215"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.45%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,833"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""28.70%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""168"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""3.40%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,333"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""23.64%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""98,723"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""177.26%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""40,266"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""59.49%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""5,398"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""36.46%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""336"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""2.27%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""12,823"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""139.91%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""19,108"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""35.66%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""84"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""1.49%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""126"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""1.62%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,651"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""39.03%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,358"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""55.74%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""26,652"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""130.36%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,078"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""11.12%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,547"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""17.20%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""859"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""3.69%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""324"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""3.28%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""944"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""16.74%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""24,399"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""58.66%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""6,214"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""41.97%""}}",4,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:41.567644,2025-12-15T19:12:41.568959
2021/000009,Stop (((5G))) - Stay Connected but Protected,"5G deployment is putting our rights to a healthy environment, freedom and privacy at stake.
               
               We call on the Commission to propose legislation to protect citizens and the environment from these threats:
               

               1. Humans, fauna and flora are being harmed by radiation. Current exposure limits provide insufficient protection — especially for vulnerable people (like children, pregnant women, patients, the elderly), animals, pollinating insects and plants
               
               — Enact regulation to protect all life from radio frequency and microwave radiation *
               

               2. With 5G the amount of connected electronic devices, antennas and satellites will explode. Unsustainable energy consumption, radiation emissions, harmful mining and pollution will  follow, which will endanger biodiversity and natural habitats
               
               — Enact stronger regulation to protect the environment from all the impacts of 5G and digitalization*
               

               3. 5G enables massive data colle","Enact regulation to protect all life from radio frequency and microwave radiation Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies independent from industry including the most recent research prove radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF) have harmful bioeffects at intensities millions of times lower than current limits. We demand the application of the precautionary principle to RF EMF in order to protect against risks to the environment and human health Ten proposals to implement in EU law 1. Enact RF EMF exposure limits based on all health and biological effects, not only those related to temperature, to protect humans – above all children, pregnant women, patients, the elderly, the infirm, electrohypersensitive people (EHS), those injured by this radiation and those using electromedical devices or implants; apply the precautionary principle 2. Update Recommendation 1999/519/EC and Workplace Directive 2013/35/EU. These ""should be regularly reviewed and reassessed"" 3. Recommendation 1999/519/EC and Workplace Directive 2013/35/EU ""must be based on the best available scientific data"". We demand limits are set to the MOST PROTECTIVE AMONG ALL scientific and empirical guidelines available, including • Council of Europe Resolution 1815 • Bioinitiative 2012 • Building biology evaluation guidelines • EUROPAEM EMF Guideline 2016 4. Ensure additional exposure guidelines are made by scientists with biomedical expertise and who are free from conflicts of interest: appoint a new panel or expand SCHEER’s activities to assess RF EMF’s bioactive parameters 5. Ensure the testing of wireless devices, antennas and their operation assesses all biologically active parameters of RF EMF 6. Replace wireless connections with cables. Do so immediately in places such as hospitals, kindergartens, schools, retirement homes, all public buildings 7. Educate the public on the hazards associated with wireless connections and how to minimize  exposure (e.g. using cables) 8. Advise member states to provide low/no radiation zones in municipalities. Declare all nature reserves and parks low/no radiation zones 9. In order to protect human health and bio-integrity, ask EU citizens for informed consent before exposing them to RF EMF 10. On the basis of the precautionary principle, enact a directive regarding RF EMF exposure  limits for the protection of fauna and flora Enact stronger regulation to protect the environment from all the impacts of 5G and digitalization Far from being a step towards an energy efficient and sustainable future, 5G and the introduction of the Internet of Things will greatly contribute to pollution and resource depletion. By 2025 they could account for 20% of worldwide electricity consumption Eight proposals to implement in EU law 11. Update Directive 2011/92/EU to include 5G deployment and all telecommunication as projects in Annex 1 to ensure that such projects are made subject to environmental assessment or a screening as prescribed by the directive 12. Reduce the massive electricity consumption caused by digital communication technology by prioritizing wired and low energy solutions in the action plan for the European Green Deal 13. Include ""Waste from Electrical and Electronical Equipment"" (WEEE), other waste products, and the environmental impacts of mining for rare earth minerals and metals used in electronical equipment in the “Zero pollution action plan” 14. Update Ecodesign Directive from 2009 setting tight limits to resource and energy waste of all connected devices including antennas and satellites 15. Recognize all biologically harmful parameters of RF EMF as a pollutant. Include them in all relevant EU Policies and Directives 16. Include monitoring of all biological harmful parameters of RF EMF in Environmental monitoring programmes, Biodiversity Strategy 2030, EU Nature restoration targets, Habitats and Birds Directives and Natura 2000 17. Call for an immediate moratorium on 5G satellites mega-constellations worldwide until the environmental adverse effects are resolved 18. Make an environmental impact assessment of all space projects a priority within the European Space Policy Enact effective data protection to safeguard our privacy, security and freedom Current data protection is insufficient in an Internet of Bodies and Things scenario in which all devices are collecting our data 24/7, to be processed as Big Data by artificial intelligence which has been proven to reproduce and aggravate discrimination.  It is also extremely concerning that 70% of investment in 5G is in surveillance systems, including facial recognition cameras and drones. Five proposals to implement in EU law 19. Launch an impact assessment of the effects of 5G, including connected objects and bodies, on personal data protection and evaluate compliance against current data protection laws 20. Protect citizens against the increasing cybercrime by applying the principle of data minimization to collection via wireless (such as medical and banking data) 21. Ensure the European Data Protection Board fight actively and independently against discrimination and digital rights violations 22. Require each citizen’s explicit consent in order to subject their data to any automated procedure 23. Organize public debates on whether or to what extent to authorise digital innovations, led by scientists with biomedical expertise and who are free from conflicts of interest: appoint a new ethics committee or expand EGE's activities * Study our more detailed annex in the additional information",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2021/000009_en,07/10/2021,01/03/2022,01/03/2023,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""07/10/2021""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""01/03/2022""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""01/03/2023""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""02/03/2023""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Denmark"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","9,280.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Sycoma"",""date"":""19/01/2023"",""amount_in_eur"":""5,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""diagnose:funk."",""date"":""28/05/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""3,400""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""The Civil Health Rights Movement May Day"",""date"":""01/08/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""880""}]","83,159","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,259"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""24.33%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,633"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""11.03%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""166"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""1.39%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,075"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""12.71%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""271"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""6.41%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""392"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""2.65%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,858"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""28.96%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""241"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""4.88%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,175"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""11.90%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,595"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""8.25%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""33,152"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""48.98%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""963"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""6.50%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""837"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""5.65%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""333"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""3.63%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,486"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""6.51%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""97"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""1.25%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""257"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""6.08%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""29"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.69%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,331"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""21.18%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""718"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""1.96%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""110"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.74%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""5,180"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""22.27%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,601"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""36.48%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""921"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""16.33%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""11,615"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""27.92%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,849"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""12.49%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:41.659749,2025-12-15T19:12:41.661086
2021/000010,Call to Action – Environmental protection in all policies,"The Commission has to safeguard and improve Europeans' quality of life, whilst protecting other species and the natural environment as a whole. Thereby, the Commission must propose a legal act- recommendation that leads to a better understanding and compliance with environmental protection measures in  EU Member States.
               

               The objective of the initiative is for the Commission to propose a legal act that would assure Europeans that their national authorities are taking into account environmental considerations when introducing new or amending existing policies.","The last five years were the warmest in recorded history. The average global temperature last year was 0.6 ° C above the thirty-year average. Scientists' reports show that Eastern and Southern Europe are among those regions (along with Alaska, the Arctic, South Africa and Australia) that are most exposed to global warming. In 2021, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report showed, that governmets are lacking in implementation of measures to protect the Environment and that we are coming to the point of irreversibility. Lack of implementation of measures is also at the centre of the 7th Environmental Report. Climate change is happening faster and faster, and its impacts will increase. This will change climate and environmental patterns in the future by further rising temperatures, extending warm and growing seasons in areas of greater latitude, lead to changes in rainfall patterns, as well as more frequent droughts and heat waves, stronger and more frequent tropical cyclones and other weather extremes. On 28 January 2019, the European Parliament declared an extreme climate conditions. When considering two resolutions, the European Parliament set out the European Commission's obligation to set out an action plan in line with the commitment to limit global warming to less than 1.5 ° C. In so doing, the EU will have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and become climate neutral by 2050. Our ecosystems are undoubtedly threatened by both climate change and unsustainable production and distribution of goods and services. As a result, we have essentially been in an environmental crisis for several decades, which has only been intensifying in recent years. We are losing forests and biodevelopment faster than ever before, glaciers are shrinking, amount of waste is increasing, water sources are put under stress, and marine life is deteriorating. With the industrial revolution, the social understanding of nature and the environment became entirely egocentric, with the consumer society, with its flourishing in recent decades, thoroughly undermining the foundations of environmental stability. The problem has grown from a regional to a global level. Mankind today is facing not only a decline in environmental quality standards, but also a fundamental issue of survival. We are facing increasing environmental challenges, with climate change representing only the tip of the iceberg. Many other complex environmental problems, including the loss of forests and biodiversity, accumulation of waste, soil poisoning and endangering our greatest asset – drinking water are also becoming more prevalent. We are in an environmental crisis that, especially among young people, has given a sense of helplessness, yet at the same time has led to an increase in interest in shaping future policies.

2021/000011,Green VAT - An EU Green VAT to stimulate sustainable and eco-friendly products and services,Reducing the VAT rate for green products and services,"It is the 21st century, ""the digital decade"" according to the President of the European Commission. These days, almost anything is possible online. All it takes is just one click to buy shoes from Italy or superfruits from South America. E-commerce is booming, but this also has its downsides. Climate change is omnipresent, and the question of what each individual can do to support climate protection is becoming more and more prominent in the minds of Europe's citizens. For consumers, it is difficult to determine whether the products they buy have been produced using eco-friendly or sustainable methods. Although the consumer has little influence over this process, the legislators do. In every country of the European Union, B2C merchants are required to pay VAT to the state. In turn, they add the amount to be paid to the purchase price of the goods that customers buy. Thus, the amount of VAT as a component of the price has an influence on the end consumer's purchasing decisions. Every Member State of the European Union could actively support climate and environmental protection by reducing the VAT rate for ""green"" products. In addition, incentives would be created for businesses to produce in a resource and environmentally-friendly way and to invest in research. A win-win situation for everyone involved – especially for our future and the protection of our planet. With our Green VAT legislative initiative we are appealing to the European Commission to initiate tax reductions for ecological, sustainably-produced and environmentally-friendly products in Europe. VAT is available to every government in the European Union as a fiscal policy tool. A corresponding EU requirement would have to be implemented by all EU Member States.

               Council recommendation on protecting the model of sport in Europe based on values, solidarity, sustainability, and open competitions
               

               The European model of sport is based on popular principles such as sporting merit, promotion and relegation, qualification to Europe via domestic success, and financial solidarity. This model and its principles must be further protected at the EU-level to prevent any more super league style breakaway attempts and protect our clubs, communities and competitions from hostile and reckless corporate and financial prospecting into European sport by private organisations and sovereign wealth funds.
               

               Sport is an integral part of the fabric of European society and culture that must be protected and promoted for the benefit of all.
               

               We are calling on the Council to adopt a Recommendation providing an EU framework and guidelines for member state action to:
               

               • Protec","BACKGROUND The super league fiasco proved that European sport is on the brink of catastrophe. Decades of mismanagement has left countless clubs and competitions vulnerable to predatory takeovers by private individuals and groups whose only aim is to make money. Enough is enough. Sport is a social good that belongs to everyone—not just the wealthy and the elite. Now more than ever, it is crucial that the institutions of the European Union, Member States, and politicians work with fans and concerned citizens to safeguard football and other sports across the continent. OBJECTIVES This means turning the post-super league outpouring of indignation, solidarity, and common purpose into a clear, practical, and long-term plan of action at the European level. Such a plan must be devised and implemented swiftly to deter further breakaway attempts, as well as continued toxic investment in and asset stripping of clubs and communities. Failure to do so will no doubt embolden the usual suspects. Indeed, it will not be long until they renew their efforts to replace the European model of sport with a cartel model that preserves and promotes their own narrow competitive and economic interests at the expense of the wider game and European society. The basis for action, and for policy, is, thankfully, provided by EU treaties, which direct and empower the Council and Commission to defend a values-driven, socially embedded, and open vision of European sport: “Union action shall be aimed at developing the European dimension in sport, by promoting fairness and openness in sporting competitions.” It is time to live up to that vision—it is time to ensure that everybody must Win It On The Pitch: protect European sport and recognise its contribution to European society.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2022/000001_en,02/02/2022,13/03/2022,13/03/2023,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""02/02/2022""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""13/03/2022""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""13/03/2023""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""14/06/2023""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""France"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,"3,594","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""36"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""60"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.08%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""140"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""1.65%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""0"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.00%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""107"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.72%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""46"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.47%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""175"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.77%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,159"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""2.08%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""514"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.76%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""14"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""149"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""1.63%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""183"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.17%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""43"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""49"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.33%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""89"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.38%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""4"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""107"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""1.90%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""629"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""1.51%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""31"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.21%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:41.913758,2025-12-15T19:12:41.914990
2022/000002,Fur Free Europe,"Fur farming is inherently cruel and it is widely rejected by EU citizens.
               

               It is impossible to improve the welfare of animals on fur farms. Whilst no animals should live in a caged environment, the keeping of inherently wild species in cages can only be defined as abject cruelty.
               

               The keeping and killing of animals solely for the purpose of fur production is ethically unacceptable.
               

               Numerous outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms have evidenced the veterinary-public health risks associated with the production of fur.
               

               The existence of production bans in some Member States has a distorting impact on the market for the supply of farmed fur products. This favours traders in those Member States where there is no production ban, to the detriment of those EU countries where outright bans are already in place.
               

               The placing of fur products on the internal markets of several territories and jurisdictions has already been prohibited. This inc","The need for an EU-wide ban on fur farming This European Citizens’ Initiative aims to achieve an EU-wide ban on: - keeping and killing of animals for the sole or main purpose of fur production. - placing farmed animal fur, and products containing such fur, on the EU market. Reasons why European citizens want an end on fur farming: 1) Fur farming contravenes even the most basic concept of animal welfare. Behavioural needs of animals farmed for fur cannot be met in fur farms. Neither the five freedoms, nor the five domains, can be met whilst undertaking this activity. 2) The vast majority of animals kept for fur production are still essentially wild animals. They are unsuitable to be intensively kept in caged confinement. When it comes to other animal species, like rabbits and chinchillas, the purpose of keeping animals in small cages and killing them solely or mainly because of the value of their fur cannot be legitimised either. 3) The Commission has announced its intention to phase out caged confinement for species that are farmed for food. Continuing to cage animals for fur production can no longer be justified. 4) A clear majority of EU citizens want to see fur farming banned and, increasingly, more Member States are taking action to eliminate fur production at national level. 5) The co-legislators have expressed their concerns about fur farming. 6) Fur farms pose a risk to animal and human health, as illustrated during the Covid-19 pandemic when hundreds of mink farms were affected by coronavirus outbreaks and new virus variants of SARS-CoV-2 were found to have been transmitted to humans. 7) Fur farming has a significant environmental impact and it poses a serious threat to native biodiversity. 8) A marked divergence between national laws with respect to the fur production sector has led to a distortion in the Union’s internal market, and the only justifiable solution is now to impose an outright ban. 9) The marketing of farmed fur and products containing such fur should not be allowed in the EU.",Answered

2022/000004,"Good Clothes, Fair Pay","We call on the European Commission to propose legislation requiring undertakings active in the garment and footwear sector to conduct due diligence in respect of living wages in their supply chains.
               
               The legislation shall achieve the following objectives:
               
               . complement and build on the EU’s Sustainable Corporate Governance framework, and the EU Adequate Minimum Wage Directive;
               
               . require undertakings to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse impacts on the human right to a living wage and freedom of association and collective bargaining rights;
               
               . reduce poverty in the EU and worldwide, paying particular attention to the circumstances of women, migrants and workers with precarious contracts and the need to combat child labour;
               
               . prohibit unfair trading practices which cause, or contribute to, actual and potential harms to workers in the garment and footwear sector and promote fair purchasing practices;
               
               . ","This ECI calls on the Commission to propose targeted due diligence legislation to ensure workers’ human right to a living wage is protected across the supply chains of garment, textile, leather and footwear companies. In many EU Member States in which the garment sector is a large employer, the statutory minimum wage only accounts for a small percentage of a living wage. In the major garment-producing countries outside the EU the statutory minimum wage is on average, less than 50% of what is needed to finance a basic decent life. Long-standing economic hardship faced by workers has been exacerbated by an increase in harmful commercial practices and wage theft during the COVID-19 crisis. Workers’ wages in the garment industry decreased by more than 20% between March and August 2020. The ILO has expressed particular concerns regarding the disproportionate gender-specific impacts of the pandemic. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights enshrine the right to a remuneration providing all workers, at a minimum, with a decent living for themselves and their families. Addressing living wages would result in EU garment and footwear consumption contributing to the achievement of the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely the eradication of poverty, gender equality, decent work and sustainable production and consumption. Furthermore, addressing low wages tackles one of the key drivers of child labour. This is in line with the Commission’s commitment towards the elimination of child labour, which the EC has emphasised needs to be kept at the forefront of all relevant policy areas. Legislation in this field should complement the Directive on Corporate Sustainable Due Diligence and the Adequate Minimum Wage Directive. It shall require undertakings to identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy adverse impacts on living wages, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the regions they source from, taking account of the right to equal pay for equal work. The undertakings shall be required to track and communicate the progress of the mitigating measures taken within the due diligence process, including through a publicly available time-bound and target-bound plan, assessed on a yearly basis. All relevant stakeholders shall be fully involved in the design and implementation of the undertakings’ due diligence processes. The Commission may recommend appropriate and legitimate methodologies for the determination of living wages. Such living wage benchmarks may likewise be taken into account for wage negotiations in the sector. Undertakings should encourage as much as possible collective bargaining agreements at supplier level to increase wages. In addition, the legislation shall build on the Directive on unfair trading practices in the agri-food sector. As evidenced by the ILO,  the garment and footwear sector is one of the sectors most affected by unfair trading practices. Given fears that buyers may end  business relationships if suppliers do not accept their conditions, many suppliers do not have sufficient bargaining power to defend themselves against unfair practices, including unfair pricing. The prohibition of unfair trading practices is necessary, particularly in order to protect workers which eventually have to bear the consequences of these unfair trading practices. To ensure accountability, it is also necessary to improve transparency in the sector. Undertakings shall make publicly available an annual report on the strategy and implementation of their obligations on their websites. Furthermore, legislation shall provide an obligation for undertakings to publish certain production information from their supply chains and a right to information for consumers regarding actual and potential adverse impacts related to wages and precarious contracting arrangements. In addition, the legislation shall address the high mobility of demand, which is one of the key structural challenges in the garment and footwear sector. As if it were nothing more than a commodity, purchasers of footwear and garment can move from one production zone to another to obtain the lowest labour costs. Consequently, national governments cannot increase their minimum wage levels without risking losing business to countries with lower wage levels. In order to reverse this race to the bottom, undertakings shall be subject to enhanced scrutiny as long as they supply goods from high-risk low-wage countries where the minimum statutory wage level in the sector is below the wage risk point and freedom of association and collective bargaining are not guaranteed. The Commission has applied a similar approach in its proposal for a Regulation on deforestation-free products. These structural challenges pinpoint the urgent need for EU intervention. Some undertakings have made commitments to improve wages, but systemic progress in the sector is still timid. In an interconnected market, the ability of any single undertaking to bring about systemic change is limited. The EU is a key market and, as such, has considerable leverage to address the challenges of poverty wages in global supply chains.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2022/000004_en,01/06/2022,19/07/2022,19/07/2023,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""01/06/2022""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""19/07/2022""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""19/07/2023""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""21/10/2023""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Netherlands"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":7},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","730,516.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Laudes Foundation"",""date"":""21/10/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""245,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Laudes Foundation"",""date"":""10/10/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""80,016""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASN Bank"",""date"":""01/07/2019"",""amount_in_eur"":""376,900""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""FNV Mondiaal"",""date"":""09/06/2021"",""amount_in_eur"":""28,600""}]","216,100","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,795"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""13.40%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,235"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""28.61%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""131"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""1.09%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,233"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""14.57%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""62"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""1.47%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,473"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""16.70%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,695"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""17.17%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""82"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""1.66%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""6,609"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""66.96%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""30,372"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""54.53%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""27,688"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""40.91%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""381"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""2.57%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""354"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""2.39%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,291"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""46.82%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""16,361"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""30.54%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""85"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""1.51%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""77"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.99%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""617"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""14.59%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""103"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""2.43%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""73,792"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""360.93%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,978"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""10.85%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""662"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""4.47%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,064"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""13.17%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""16,318"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""165.33%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""284"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""5.04%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""6,384"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""15.35%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""12,974"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""87.63%""}}",2,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:42.220961,2025-12-15T19:12:42.222262

We say stop to the energy war, we prepare local turbine pump systems of up to 400kw, drip irrigation systems and hydrogen generators for compact energy zones.
               
               A major step for competitiveness in the EU.","Three photovoltaic panels and 0.6kw wind turbines with inverters using EU funding for every household in the Community area and associated countries e.g. MD . Sources of financing. Money not used for resilience, cohesion and regional development. 197 000 000 EU households 600 000 000 photovoltaic panels. 197 000 MW green energy Estimated costs 750 billion euro EU-wide. Only EU equipment. No approvals, no metering, with grounding systems and existing one-way meters. Distribution, inventory and payments by ATU (municipality). Retention period of 15 years without changing the energy distributor. ADI (Intercommunity Development Association) clusters GAL, ATU and county and regional councils can take over photovoltaic sites used at 50% of the price and make up the difference using wind turbines for which they will distribute green stamps to EU citizens. Citizens can exchange up to 8% of their green stamps with energy-dependent regional economic agents who ensure the maintenance of the green systems. Green stamps generated in the EU originating in Malta and Cyprus can be cashed in northern Sweden. We are laying the foundations for a green European energy union. The ATUs (the municipalities) must ensure that 50% of sites are at the end of the network areas with daily overconsumption to consolidate the existing networks, and in all substation transformers from the administrative area. The loss from the system of 5 to 8 per cent will be transformed into a surplus in the day system of 10% to 15%, resulting in the constant non-use of up to 15% of this generation system. Once the project is finalised, traders setting energy prices for the following day will no longer aim to manipulate the price of energy.

2022/000007,"Protect the EU’s Rural Heritage, Food Security and Supply","PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE EU’S RURAL AREAS AND FOOD SECURITY.
               




                Europe’s rural regions are losing their heritage, industries, populations, and values – threatening food security and supply across the EU. To preserve what makes these regions unique for future generations and ensure the longevity of the EU’s food-producing communities, we need a renewed EU commitment to the promotion of regional heritage, rural sustainable growth and rising living standards.
               



                This European Citizens Initiative asks the EU to modernise its rural commitments to take into consideration the need for greater food security, supply of agricultural materials and protection for the rural way of life – its people, their values and livelihoods.","The EU must respect its rural communities, their heritage, and values. Europe has a proud tradition of supporting its agricultural and rural-based communities and their way of life. And yet, our rural sectors and those that work them face increasing pressure and diminishing incentives to continue, which, if not addressed, will lead to the extinction of some of Europe’s most foundational communities and values. The textiles industry is a prime example, which has become centred around fast fashion rather than environmentally sustainable slow and natural fibre-based fashion. We wish for the EU to promote and support environmentally sustainable rural production of goods, food and other agricultural outputs across the Member States. As such, this Citizens’ Initiative aims, within the competencies conferred to the EU by the Treaties: -   We request the EU Commission to create a proposal to strengthen and preserve regional heritages and industries throughout the EU. The proposal must boost rural growth and promote rural job practices and activities such as agriculture (family to large-scale), gamekeeping, horticulture and natural fibre production in the textile industry (wool, silk, fur and cotton) that are at the heart of rural communities. It is necessary for the proposal to consider and respect the traditional crafting industries that rely on rurally sourced materials and smaller fringe businesses that service large-scale farms. The proposal must recognise food security and supply (fertiliser, biogas materials etc.) and the importance of maintaining a robust regional food supply in Europe. -   Promote investment and rising living standards in rural communities by developing regional heritage focused tourism, education and industry across the EU, with respect to sustainable production. -   While welcoming the EU’s Green initiatives, the Commission must consult with local and rural representatives on the details of implementation. We, EU citizens, invite the Commission to introduce by law, throughout the Union, the: -   The inclusion of rural heritage promotion and recognition of food security/supply in the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, providing investment and legislative protection for traditional practices. This would include updating Rural Development Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 or its successor to have a larger emphasis on the promotion and investment in local cultural heritage, where it can demonstrate increased use of sustainable production and protection of the EU’s food security. -   The Long-term Vision for the EU’s Rural Areas up to 2040, Rural Pact and EU Rural Action Plan should increase their scope to include investment and legislative protection for rural heritage where it can demonstrate increased use of sustainable production and promotion of EU food security and supply.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2022/000007_en,07/09/2022,02/11/2022,03/11/2023,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""07/09/2022""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""02/11/2022""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""03/11/2023""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""06/02/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Lithuania"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","200,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""International Fur Federation (IFF)"",""date"":""13/07/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""200,000""}]","21,410","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""75"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.56%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""121"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.82%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""21"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.25%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""88"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.59%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""119"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.21%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""4"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.08%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""488"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""4.94%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""240"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""0.43%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""312"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.46%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""14,736"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""99.53%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,178"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""7.96%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""36"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.39%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""261"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.49%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.11%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,004"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""25.84%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""68"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.33%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""419"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""1.14%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""552"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""3.73%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""126"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.54%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""16"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.16%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""19"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""461"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""1.11%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""25"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.17%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:42.463645,2025-12-15T19:12:42.465034
2022/000008,Focus on Specific Learning Disabilities on EU Level,"This Initiative aims to facilitate the access to education of people with specific learning disabilities (i.e. dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia). Students with such disabilities face struggles in pursuing their education due to lack of knowledge about the topic, absence of adequate study materials, and unfair exam conditions.
               
               Although the Member States have addressed the issue individually, the discrepancies in  the definitions of learning disabilities, the distinct methods of detection and assistance opens a gap between the countries. Hence, students may be treated differently in other Member States which could hinder their right of free movement as granted by the Treaties, resulting in repercussions on their education and integration into society.
               
               Hereby, we request the Commission to present a proposal for a Council recommendation pursuant to Article 165(4), second indent, TFEU with common guidelines to the national governments on how to detect and address learning disabilities. A better integration of people with learn","Nowadays, the European Union is facing multiple issues of inclusivity, as shown in the EU disabilities strategy (2021 - 2027). In order to ensure that every student, diagnosed with a form of a specific learning disability in the EU, is granted the compensatory method that they need, it is important that the Commission encourages the Member States to work together. This initiative aims to address specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, disprassia, disortografia though, we see the possibility of enlarging the scope. We consider this proposal as a major step towards tackling the inclusivity issues highlighted in the EU disability strategy. With this initiative, we ask the Commission to present a proposal for a Council recommendation pursuant to art 165(4), second indent, TFEU. Moreover, research has proven that not integrating people with specific learning disabilities in schools can have repercussions on both their individual development and on their position in society. If dyslexia is not addressed properly, it can cause anxiety, anger issues and depression. It can also have a negative effect on people’s social and communication skills, as well as in their relationships with their parents and siblings (International Dyslexia Association, 2022). Another study reveals that dyslexic people who have failed in their studies are more likely to pursue criminal activities (Macdonald, 2012). However, if students struggling with this kind of disabilities are helped from an early stage both in the family and in school, it is more likely that they develop an “emotional well-being” (International Dyslexia Association, 2022). Although these articles focus on dyslexia, the most known form of a specific learning disability, we can assume that all individuals who struggle with a specific learning disability are at risk to the above-mentioned negative consequences. International Dyslexia Association states that a clear understanding of the issues reduces the difficulties for a person with specific learning disabilities to integrate into society. Therefore, this initiative has three key points. First, it can highlight  the globality of the issue and the need to tackle it on a European level.  For instance, it is difficult to estimate exactly how many people have specific learning disabilities for a number of reasons. To begin with, each Member State uses a different medical definition and includes a different set of disabilities when creating their legislations on the matter. (A comparative study about different legal definitions in some EU countries is attached to this Annex.) Furthermore, not all people with learning disabilities get diagnosed or seek support. When it actually comes to detection, the Member States delegate the responsibility to different specialists: neurologists, psychologists, specifically trained teachers, etc. Hence, the detection methods also vary from simple tests to detailed neurological analyses. This initiative aims to ameliorate these discrepancies. Second, with its team of experts and broader perspective of the Member States’ legislations, the Commission can significantly contribute to the research on specific learning disabilities. This research should focus on finding a European-wide definition of learning disabilities and establishing compensatory measures. A common definition would secure the protection of students with specific learning disabilities' rights when moving to study in another Member State. Although disabilities affect students differently, and it is best that the compensatory measures are tailor made according to the individual’s necessities, there are already some practices that could be commonly applied. For example, slight adjustments in the grading system, granting more time during exams and allowing the use of a computer can already significantly improve  the student’s potential. Third, it can stress the importance of using new technologies in facilitating the learning process for students with learning disabilities. One of the most useful compensatory methods so far is the computer which provides students with reading aloud softwares, orthographic correctors, etc. These two options can significantly improve the comprehension and writing skills of people with dyslexia and dysgraphia. Computers can also secure a fairer treatment during exams and, thus, help students reveal their full potential. Since some poorer European regions do not invest in bringing new technologies to the classrooms, the EU can bring the national governments’ attention to the issue and to the potential of the newest technologies.

Making available the vegan alternative in the sale of food and drinks to the public allows: - to make easier the access to the vegan alternative and to respect the vegan cruelty-free choice, the right to choose how to eat to be kind to our animal friends, to have food that makes us feel good, to bring hope to our future to increase the consumption of plant-based foods by taking advantage of the services for the sale of vegan food and beverages. When we cannot choose to look elsewhere, i.e. in schools, canteens, and hospitals, but also in drinks vending machines, the vegan alternative must be guaranteed in the sale of food and drinks to the public, that is it must be easy to find the vegan alternative available also in bars, restaurants, pizza parlours, sandwich bars, ice cream shops, motorway service areas; - to help fight the climate crisis by increasing the consumption of plant-based food both for a greater offer and for the advertising of the vegan alternative in the presence of the vegan option, creating a change both on land and in the sea with less pollution related to production, but also to distribution and storage, therefore with energy saving as well as less contamination and alteration of the planet. We will only help to save our planet; - to reduce the cost of food in economic terms and with regard to pollution, but also to reduce the suffering of animals. Sustainable vegan eating is cheaper, fresh seasonal vegetables are preferred and many logistical aspects are simplified in relation to production, storage, and transport saving not only energy but also human and instrumental resources. Cruelty-free vegan diet does not imply the exploitation and killing of animals, responding to the emerging collective awareness of animal rights. Furthermore, the vegan diet changes the territory in the choice of production and employment activities, structures, and logistics with less pollution. We can say that a less polluted environment is healthier, therefore the effect of vegan diet makes us live in a healthier environment making us healthier. The vegan choice for a fairer world for people, animals, and the environment. The results that can derive from the EU Citizens' Initiative for VEGAN MEAL, i.e. facilitating the availability of vegan food in public and private sectors of food and beverage sales, concern less pollution in CO2 emissions, less environmental contamination, less water use, and generate less suffering for animals. When a significant number of consumers choose vegan products as in VEGANUARY 2022, an international initiative dedicated to encouraging the vegan diet alternative during the month of January, important results are obtained for people, animals, and the environment. Let's see together the report of VEGANUARY 2022 with a record of 600,000 new subscribers this year, bringing more than 2,000,000 people closer to the VEGANUARY initiative since its beginning and with incredible results in reducing the environmental impact that has saved over 200,000 tons of fossil coal avoiding it from reaching the atmosphere, so as to travel around the planet by car 30,000 times, or equal to one million flights London-Berlin. According to the Vegan Society, promoter of VEGANUARY, only this year's new members have been spared the lives of 6,000,000 animals. Water resources saved over 12,000 tons of water to be purified by preventing its entry into watercourses with great benefits, and the use of 12,000,000 tons of water was saved, equivalent to using the toilet a million times. Finally, good news, thanks to the VEGANUARY initiative at least 10 times the same number of participants take part in VEGANUARY without registering, so the results obtained should be multiplied by 10, making it clear what veganism is doing for the planet. Based on the results obtained by encouraging the consumption of plant-based food, as demonstrated in VEGANUARY 2022, the EU Citizens' Initiative for VEGAN MEAL asks for the introduction of the vegan alternative in the sale of food and beverages to the public in Europe by law with the hope that the participation of European citizens leads to the approval of an EU law with great benefits for the planet, i.e. in mitigation of the climate crisis, extinction of wild species, deforestation, better use of land, defense of marine life, food waste and malnutrition. We urgently need action rather than empty words. We know what needs to be done. What is missing is the political will to take a new approach and a real commitment. Be vegan to defend nature. A well-planned vegan diet is suitable for all stages of life, even in childhood, and satisfies the need for all nutrients: this is officially stated in an article published recently in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The EU Citizens' Initiative for VEGAN MEAL asks for a law to make easier access to the vegan alternative, i.e. that the vegan alternative has to be guaranteed in the sale of food and drinks to the public, with the awareness of the change in society, economy, and the environment that we generate when we choose vegan food. Aspects that we believe are positive, non-discriminatory, and non-harmful, in line with the transition to a more eco-sustainable diet.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2022/000009_en,18/10/2022,05/04/2023,05/04/2024,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""18/10/2022""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""05/04/2023""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""05/04/2024""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""07/04/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Italy"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":1},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",500.00,"[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Private sponsor"",""date"":""10/03/2023"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""}]","8,003","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""209"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""1.56%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""180"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.22%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""29"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""41"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.48%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""20"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""38"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.39%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""20"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""129"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.31%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""741"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""1.33%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,258"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""4.81%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""95"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.64%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""213"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.44%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""53"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.58%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,006"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""3.74%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""12"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""24"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.31%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""28"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""194"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.95%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""126"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""84"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.57%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""96"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""55"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.56%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""21"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.37%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""264"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.63%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""57"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.39%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:42.632582,2025-12-15T19:12:42.633824
2022/000010,"European Day of ""Whatever it Takes""","Plea for the institutionalization of a European Day of Whatever it Takes
               

               An appeal to the EU Commission for the institutionalization of the European Day of “Whatever it Takes”- 26.07.2012 to mark in history the institutional wisdom and game-changing capacity of the European Institutions during the Great Recession. An inspiring chapter of EU’s functional resiliency and core capabilities for institutions, nations and societies to drive progress while sailing times of multiple-crisis management.","This Initiative is a brief statement of love for Europe, a gesture of positivity in times of easy hate and a public appeal to bring voices together around EU institutions and their values against a landscape of societal polarization, geopolitical conflict and economic instability. This initiative is a collective statement of faith in Europe and confidence in its adaptive capacity to navigate through present and future storms, towards an “ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe”. Ten years after Draghi’s “three magic words” that changed the course of a crisis that left the Eurozone on the brink of collapse, Europe is once again sailing through uncharted waters that require extraordinary capacity of collective action. While leaving behind a pandemic and facing an unprovoked war at home, Europe is dealing with unprecedented inflationary pressures threatening the Eurozone in an asymmetric way, with the financial markets once again, challenging the integrity of the EMU while testing the policy menu of the ECB. Ten years ago, ECB shifted its profile of action within the limitations of TFEU and took the front of EU’s collective response against the sharpest recession affecting postwar Europe. When the liquidity crunch degenerated into a solvency shock and national governments turned their efforts to save their banking systems and budgetary equilibria, ECB decisively broke the deadly spiral of negative market sentiment over sovereign debts and national economies. The real purpose of this initiative is to set in stone this inspiring chapter in EU history as a landmark of our collective capacity to overcome common obstacles to our development and build back better as a democratic block of nations jointly striving for progress. Today, it’s fairly indisputable how instrumental Mr. Draghi’s leadership was in readapting the algorithms of the ECB - a heart-institution of the EMU - making it a better-equipped central bank in support of Eurozone economies. The “three magic words”, part of a non- standard speech in London (2012, July), marked day one of a new monetary era with an immediate stabilizing effect on financial markets. They also represented the beginning of the end of the sovereign debt crisis. They not only resulted in the salvation of the Eurozone but they also loosened the “deadly embrace” between banks and sovereign economies facing simultaneous solvency and liquidity shocks. PROPOSAL This Citizens' Initiative aims to mobilize EU voices around the ideal of a wider recognition of our collective wins and the proven capacity to overcome major obstacles. The strength of a symbolic representation by celebrating a “Whatever it Takes” Day depends on the institutional solemnity bestowed upon it and ultimately, on its cultural alignment with EU fundamental values. Aligned with the EU founding fathers, statesmen of dialogue who lived through two world wars and experienced bridging cultural differences based on a common search for peace and prosperity, we propose to carve into EU contemporary lifeline a “WiT Day” to elevate the intemporal guiding principles driving integration. The ""whatever it takes"" moment should be translated into our collective culture of action. It symbolizes the zero hour of a historical change of course during the Great Recession that saved the Euro and changed ECB for the better. It represents the turning point for European economies and macroeconomic recovery. This titanic struggle against the crisis and the complex task of changing ECB commands in the middle of a financial shock must inspire future institutional endeavors, in the name of EU’s collective progress. Our proposal to celebrate a “Whatever it Takes Day” is a symbolic act of pan-Europeanism and a lever to encourage our public institutions to continuously adapt, keeping pace with societal transformations and poised to shape the future. In rough times of supply chains disruptions, rising inflation and price instability across all Europe, the monetary policy system is back on top of political agendas. Fortunately, however, ECB is now much better equipped to respond quickly to global economic circumstances. It is our collective duty to celebrate a European Day of “Whatever it Takes” embracing an official and solemn effort to historicize the collective achievements of Europe. Marking this day in the timeline of the European construction is to commemorate the strength of our mutual beliefs, recognizing the functional wisdom of our institutions that work every day to bring nations and people together during divisive times. In essence, this manifesto offers three key messages in support of our plea for a European Day of “Whatever it Takes”: A) To set in stone one of the most critical efforts to save the Euro, as an act of recognition of the EU institutional wisdom and resilience during the Great Recession that severely threatened Eurozone and national economies; B)To bring EU voices together and celebrate the European values of democracy, cultural diversity, peace and human rights, in times of easy scorn, societal extremism, Euro-skepticism and populism rising throughout Europe; C) To shed light on the adaptive power and crisis-solving capabilities that European institutions need to maintain to drive progress and face what lies ahead. A “WiT” day is a direct appeal to the reformist capacity and transformative muscle the EU needs to preserve.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2022/000010_en,22/11/2022,20/04/2023,20/04/2024,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""22/11/2022""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""20/04/2023""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""20/04/2024""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""23/07/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Portugal"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":4},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,254,"{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.01%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""3"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""4"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.03%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""3"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.06%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.08%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""43"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""0.08%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""32"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.06%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""7"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.08%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""51"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.03%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""0"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.00%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""0"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.00%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.01%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.01%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""0"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.00%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.03%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.01%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:42.715921,2025-12-15T19:12:42.717149
2023/000001,Article 4: Stop torture and inhuman treatment at Europe’s borders,"In the context of the EU’s powers in the area of justice, freedom and security – as set out in Article 78 TFEU on policies relating to border checks, asylum and immigration – we call for appropriate regulations to ensure that Article 4 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is applied effectively and that the use of violence, torture and inhuman and degrading treatment is banned at EU borders and in non-EU countries which the European institutions or one or more Member States have concluded agreements with restricting the entry of migrants or asylum seekers into Europe, as well in the Member States themselves in managing reception, with penalties imposed for non-compliance with the obligations laid down.","Article 4 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states: ‘No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.’ In recent years, increasing violence has been perpetrated against migrants, which is a stain on our European conscience and contrasts starkly with the EU’s fundamental principles. Reports by organisations such as UNHCR, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, investigations by journalists and numerous testimonies from victims reveal torture, rape and threats in detention centres in Libya, a country which Italy has concluded departure control agreements with. Extremely poor conditions are reported in camps in Greece and Bosnia, where overcrowding and lack of hygiene and care endanger the lives of the most vulnerable. Disproportionate use of force and repeated episodes of violence by Croatian police against asylum seekers are reported at the border with Serbia and Bosnia. Migrants have been illegally detained in various EU countries and countries funded by the EU, violent pushbacks have taken place all along Europe’s borders and in practice the right to apply for asylum has been suspended. The ECI urges the EU to use its powers in the area of justice, freedom and security – set out in Article 78 TFEU on policies relating to border checks, asylum and immigration – to put an end to these frequent and repeated violations of a fundamental EU principle, as reflected in Article 4 of the Charter, and to protect migrants and asylum seekers: 1- on entry into the common European area, by regulating border checks and imposing penalties on countries that openly violate the ban on the use of violence, torture and inhuman and degrading treatment; 2- in non-EU countries, in the context of operations to ‘externalise EU borders’, by imposing penalties on Member States which conclude agreements that do not provide for the monitoring of compliance with Article 4; 3- in setting reception standards for the entire period of residence in the EU, by imposing penalties on countries whose authorities and/or law enforcement agencies infringe the rights of migrants or asylum seekers.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000001_en,12/01/2023,10/07/2023,10/07/2024,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""12/01/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""10/07/2023""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""10/07/2024""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""11/07/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Italy"":1}}","{""name"":""Basta violenza alle frontiere"",""country_of_residence"":""Italy""}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":6},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","3,300.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""SoliOli"",""date"":""21/12/2023"",""amount_in_eur"":""3,300""}]","25,124","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""200"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""1.49%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""253"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.71%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""36"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.30%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""44"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.52%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.11%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""65"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""127"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.29%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,497"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""4.48%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,899"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""4.28%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""146"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.99%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""36"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""91"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.99%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""16,817"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""31.39%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.16%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.17%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""47"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""1.11%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.35%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""192"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.94%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""450"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""1.23%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""106"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.72%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""59"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.25%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""126"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""2.23%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""803"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""1.93%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""59"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.40%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:42.796211,2025-12-15T19:12:42.797436
2023/000002,Ensuring a dignified reception of migrants in Europe,"The treatment of migrants in the European Union (EU) too often fails to respect the principles of human dignity, a fundamental value of the Union.
               

                The main reason, in our view, is the persistent inadequacy of European rules and the lack of solidarity between Member States.
               

                As the Union is ""an area of freedom, security and justice with respect for fundamental rights"",
                
                 we, European citizens, ask the EU
                 
                  to ensure a dignified reception of migrants, as soon as they enter the territory
                 

                , compatible with the fundamental rights recognized to every human being by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and international law.
               

                In order to contribute to this, we call, in the framework of the development of a common asylum policy, for the adoption of regulations to:
               

                1- Introduce a new mechanism for the distribution of asylum seekers in the EU, based on their free wil","The treatment of migrants in the European Union too often does not respect the principles of human dignity, a fundamental value of the Union (Art.2 TEU). The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states in its Article 1: ""Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected"". It also recognizes that every human being has the right to respect for fundamental rights such as the right to health, to social assistance and to housing, the right to education and the right to work. We therefore consider that all migrants have the right to human dignity and respect for fundamental rights. Despite the European Commission's constant desire to improve a dysfunctional asylum and migration regime, many legislative and policy changes remain to be adopted at both EU and national levels to ensure dignified treatment of all migrants. We believe that the Union, for its part, can advance respect for dignity in Europe by revising the asylum rules of the Dublin Regulation (I) and by making binding in the States reception standards that guarantee asylum seekers dignified living conditions that are comparable in all Member States (II). Thus, while respecting the Union's competences, our proposals for changes to secondary legislation are part of the development of a common asylum policy (Article 78§2) I. Establish a new mechanism for the distribution of asylum seekers in the EU The Dublin Regulation, which determines which European state is responsible for an asylum application, has created a counter-productive mechanism, feeding national egoisms, by which Europe condemns to wandering an increasing proportion of those who come to seek refuge. It de facto places the bulk of the responsibility for asylum demand on a few states. In 2020, almost 80% of first asylum applications were made in Greece, Italy and Spain. This imbalance leads to the persistence of undignified situations: overcrowded camps on the Greek islands or summary deportations contrary to international law at the EU's borders. In addition, almost 1 in 4 asylum seekers make their application in a state other than the one designated as responsible for the investigation. Transfers to the country of arrival remain marginal, particularly from Germany and France, which in 2019 received almost 68% of the EU's “dublined”. Thus, for a period of up to 18 months, they are condemned to wander and live in great precariousness, rarely benefiting from assistance or accommodation. We call for the adoption of a regulation which, revising Regulation 2013/604 ""Dublin III"", balances the sharing of reception in the EU, by: - a new allocation mechanism taking into account the aspirations of asylum seekers as a new criterion - and a binding solidarity (relocation) mechanism between Member States to correct disproportionate allocations. II. Make binding in the Member States reception standards that guarantee asylum seekers dignified living conditions that are comparable throughout the Union Reception conditions for asylum seekers differ greatly from one country to another and some have been found to be contrary to respect for human dignity and the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment by the European courts (CJEU, C-179/11; ECHR, N.H. and others v. France - Judgment 2.7.2020) Acknowledging these"" significant gaps"", the European Commission, in its 2016 proposal for a recast of the Reception Conditions Directive, recalled the need for ""uniform conditions"" that are sufficient ""to ensure a dignified standard of living and comparable living conditions in all Member States"". We consider that disparities between Member States will remain if these proposed provisions do not become binding and directly applicable in the Member States. We call for the adoption of a regulation (repealing Directive 2013/33/EU) on reception conditions for asylum seekers in the EU, guaranteeing them a dignified standard of living and comparable living conditions in all Member States, requiring Member States: - to fully respect fundamental rights and general principles of Union law, as well as the requirements of international law; - ensure that asylum seekers are provided with material reception conditions from the moment of their entry into the territory of the Union which comply a minima with the operational standards and indicators for material reception conditions developed at EU level by the European Asylum and Migration Office (EASO), in terms of ""accommodation, food, clothing and non-food items, daily allowance, information and counselling and health care""; - guarantee the rights of the child as they result from the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular to ensure the schooling and education of minors, without condition of residence in the Member State in which the applicant is required to be present, as long as an expulsion order is not enforced against them; - to facilitate access to employment. Applicants, regardless of the expected outcome of their application, should be allowed to work as soon as possible, within 6 months, even if their application is in process; - have emergency reception plans developed and monitored in partnership with local and regional actors, such as NGOs and local authorities.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000002_en,22/02/2023,14/04/2023,14/04/2024,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""22/02/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""14/04/2023""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""14/04/2024""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""26/04/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""France"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":4},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","50,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""City of Rennes"",""date"":""27/06/2022"",""amount_in_eur"":""50,000""}]","15,364","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""100"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.75%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""280"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.89%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""21"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""16"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.19%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""4"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""14"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""25"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.25%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""62"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.63%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""12,191"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""21.89%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""862"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""1.27%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""107"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.72%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""24"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.16%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""55"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.60%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""969"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""1.81%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.35%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""144"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.70%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""123"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""48"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.32%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""33"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""14"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.11%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""200"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.48%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""34"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.23%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:42.875646,2025-12-15T19:12:42.876904

The European Citizens’ Initiative End The Horse Slaughter Age asks for a law to ban the slaughter of horses and all other equines, including in the ban also their breeding and their export for the production of fur, leather, meat or for the manufacture of medicines or other substances, bringing horses into line with legislation regarding dogs and cats. The European Citizens’ Initiative End The Horse Slaughter Age asks also for a law to stop long-distance transportation of horses across Europe for slaughter and a regulation to protect horse from being compelled to do excess work or hard training. The European Citizens’ Initiative End The Horse Slaughter Age wants to let people know what really happens to horses in slaughterhouses by looking the truth in the face and put an end forever to the slaughter of horses that unjustly die in atrocious suffering. Based on the purpose, the European Citizens’ Initiative End The Horse Slaughter Age can be classified as: - precepts , to encourage the legislators to approve rules that fill a legislative vacuum (vacatio) for consideration of the animal rights; - aimed at raising awareness focusing the interest of the governments on the specific horse meat issue; - abrogative petition , if encouraging the legislator to repeal a specific legal rule, that is, to ban the slaughter of horses and all other equine animals, including in the ban also their breeding and their export for the production of fur, leather, meat or for the manufacture of medicines or other substances, bringing horses into line with legislation regarding dogs and cats. The slaughter of horses for human consumption is a cruel practice that animal welfare organizations have denounced for decades. Horses purchased for slaughter are not old, disabled or unwanted. Slaughter is driven by a demand for horse meat. Horse meat is unsafe for human consumption because horses aren’t raised as food animals administering drugs not for use on horses intended for human consumption. Every year around 5 million horses are slaughtered in the world, sensitive and intelligent animals that are treated like things. And Italy boasts a sad record because it is the first nation in Europe for the number of horses slaughtered and for the quantity of meat imported from abroad. These animals suffer not only in slaughterhouses where they meet a violent death, but also during long-distance transport to which they are forced.   It is impossible to humanely transport horses for slaughter. There is also the terrible problem of the illegal trade in these animals - which subjects them to further ill-treatment and deprives them of any protection. In 2020 Greece banned the slaughter of horses, including in the ban also their breeding and their export for the production of fur, leather, meat or for the manufacture of medicines or other substances, bringing horses into line with legislation regarding pets. Greece has granted horses the same protections given to dogs and cats: a decision that could act as a driving force for other European countries. At international level a new awarness is growing to ban horse slaughter in many countries. The European Citizens' Initiative End The Horse Slaughter Age is launching a collection of signatures to ask to ban the slaughter of horses and all other equines in Europe, as well as to teach to be kind to these animals protecting them in natural reserves, animal sanctuaries and adequate shelter structures with sufficient space and protection from cold, damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to health. The European Citizens’ Initiative End The Horse Slaughter Age asks also for a law to stop long-distance transportation of horses across Europe for slaughter and a regulation to protect horse from being compelled to do excess work or hard training.

2023/000004,Connecting all European capitals and people through a high-speed train network,We want to connect all European capitals through high-speed railway lines. We are calling for the European Commission to make a proposal for a legally binding act to establish a European high-speed train network as quickly as possible. This means linking up the existing high-speed railway networks and building high-speed lines where these do not yet exist.,"Why a European high-speed railway network? Train travel is sustainable and safe. High-speed trains offer a comfortable alternative to medium-haul flights. High-speed trains are inclusive and accessible to all. High-speed connections contribute to regional development and evenly distributed economic growth in the EU. High-speed railway lines lead to greater cohesion and benefit the entire population. Background: All Europeans have the right to move freely within the borders of the EU and should also be able to do so regardless of their age, financial means and physical state or mental capacity. The current high-speed railway network in Europe is over 11 500 km long and mainly connects cities in a limited number of Member States, such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Many countries of eastern Europe and relatively small countries – such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal – are not part of the European high-speed railway network. To enable safe and sustainable connections between people in Europe, it is important to link up the various networks of the individual Member States and to expand the overall network. This expansion of the high-speed railway network is also necessary in view of the increasing number of passengers. High-speed connections have been shown to lead to greater prosperity and well-being.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000004_en,18/04/2023,30/05/2023,31/05/2024,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""18/04/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""30/05/2023""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""31/05/2024""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""30/08/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,"40,682","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,133"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""8.46%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,336"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""9.02%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""492"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""4.11%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""798"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""9.43%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""33"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.78%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""506"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""3.42%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""793"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""8.03%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""179"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""3.63%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""703"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""7.12%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,532"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""6.34%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""7,966"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""11.77%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""413"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""2.79%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,056"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""7.13%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""718"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""7.83%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,197"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""4.10%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""110"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""1.95%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""320"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""4.13%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""115"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""2.72%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""27"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.64%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""7,137"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""34.91%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,593"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""7.07%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,322"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""8.93%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,503"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""15.06%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""452"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""4.58%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""712"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""12.62%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,277"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""3.07%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,259"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""8.50%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.077393,2025-12-15T19:12:43.078641
2023/000005,Effective implementation of the concept of judicial precedent in EU countries,"We would ask the European Commission to propose to the Member States (MS) that they
                
                 introduce a mechanism at national level which guarantees mutual recognition of final judicial decisions adopted by courts of other MS, and the option of invoking national judicial precedents decided by the courts of the country in question
                
                , provided that:
               

                a) the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has had occasion to interpret the applicable provisions of EU law;
               

                b) the case in question concerns similar or identical legal questions.
               

                This mechanism should be actually available to litigants, allowing them to request the recognition of another decision relevant to their case at any stage of the proceedings. Furthermore, a certain degree of flexibility should be ensured in light of the
                
                 rebus sic stantibus
                
                clause, making it possible to change the case-law if certain ","The CJEU and the EU institutions have repeatedly found that in some EU countries courts tend to apply EU law without ensuring a uniform and coherent approach (identical or similar legal issues may lead to different solutions). This not only undermines the equality of Member States before the treaties, but also leads to possible discrimination between litigants in the Member States and to significant uncertainties as to how compliance with EU law is ensured at national level. While the EU Member States continue to benefit from the relevant prerogatives in organising their own judicial systems, it is beyond dispute that fragmented and unpredictable interpretation and implementation of EU law violates the equality of MS before the treaties. This may in turn lead to a violation of the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality. The CJEU has already held that Member State prerogatives must be exercised while taking EU law into account (that is, while ensuring its effectiveness). In this context, the present initiative aims to consolidate a uniform judicial practice among the Member States, while at the same time respecting the different judicial culture and traditions (in line with Article 4(2) TEU). More specifically, the initiative aims to introduce a judicial mechanism enabling the mutual recognition of final judicial decisions adopted by other judicial authorities concerned with similar or identical matters. The mechanism should apply not only to recognising final judicial decisions adopted in other Member States, but also to recognising final judicial decisions adopted in the country in question. This is the only way to truly ensure uniformity in the judicial practice of the Union’s courts while actually respecting the rule of law and the obligations of a state subject to the rule of law defined in Article 19 TEU. This proposal is proportionate and necessary in order to ensure the protection of the rule of law and to maintain the uniform implementation of EU law, since by introducing a mechanism which leads to the recognition of earlier judicial decisions, the judicial traditions and the procedural autonomy of each Member State are preserved. It is also important to underline that the objectives of this initiative cannot be achieved by the Member States alone. The initiative’s objectives may only be achieved at Union level. The principle of subsidiarity (with respect to the non-exclusive competences of the Union) is therefore respected as well. In order to preserve the judicial autonomy of the EU before the Member States, the proposed mechanism respects the prerogatives of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the mandate conferred on the Court by the Member States. In particular, the role of the CJEU in ensuring that the law is upheld when interpreting and applying the EU treaties is protected. For this reason, the proposed mechanism applies to earlier final judicial decisions, provided that the CJEU was involved in the procedures in question, in line with Article 267 TFEU. Moreover, a court which is asked to recognise a judicial precedent should still have the possibility of referring preliminary questions to the Court of Justice. Litigants should likewise have the option of invoking a mechanism for reviewing decisions which are incompatible with judicial precedents concerning similar or identical situations. This option is missing in the judicial systems of certain Member States in which only certain bodies (for example the prosecutor-general or the ombudsman) may initiate a procedure to harmonise inconsistent judicial practices. In other cases, even though the option is technically available, it is poorly applied. The Member States would be requested to monitor the appropriate implementation of the mechanism proposed in this initiative by the national courts, meaning that the Member States could be held liable for violations of obligations under EU law in line with settled CJEU case-law. The recognition of a judicial precedent among the Member States does not require a change to their legal systems. In light of the above, there are various legal bases for the proposal. Firstly, the initiative is based on Articles 81 and 82(1) TFEU as regards the recognition of judgments with cross-border implications. Secondly, the proposal is based on Article 352 TFEU and potentially Article 114 TFEU, so as to cover all situations which lead to inconsistent application and interpretation of EU [ law ] that could impede the attainment of EU’s objectives and the proper functioning of its internal market.",Withdrawn,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000005_en,31/05/2023,17/11/2023,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""31/05/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""17/11/2023""},{""step"":""Withdrawn"",""date"":""26/03/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Romania"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","3,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASOCIAŢIA PENTRU RENAŞTEREA VALORILOR DEMOCRAŢIEI"",""date"":""01/11/2023"",""amount_in_eur"":""3,000""}]",291,"{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.07%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.01%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""3"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.03%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""4"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.04%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""34"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""0.06%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""42"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.06%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.07%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""35"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.07%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.01%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""0"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.00%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.03%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""25"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.07%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""48"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""3"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.03%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.01%""}}",0,,Withdrawn,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.174968,2025-12-15T19:12:43.176291
2023/000006,Taxing great wealth to finance the ecological and social transition.,"This initiative calls on the European Commission to establish a European tax on great wealth. This would contribute to the Union’s own resources, and the revenue would make it possible to amplify and perpetuate European ecological and social transition and development cooperation policies, cofunded by the Member States. The contribution would be used to combat climate change and inequality and would help to ensure that European citizens pay their fair share towards achieving these objectives.","For more than a decade, the crises facing the European Union have proliferated: economic, social, health, geopolitical, and environmental crises, etc. These are a symptom of the failure of the economic, tax and social policies pursued by national governments and the European Union, which have weakened health systems, public services, environmental protection, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and so on. While the Union’s objective is to promote the well-being of its peoples, combat social exclusion, guarantee social justice and social protection (Article 3 TEU) and its institutions have undertaken to ensure greater fairness, in particular in terms of taxation, inequality has grown steadily , to the point where, today, the richest 1% of the world’s people own almost half of the world’s wealth, and this 1% also produces more CO2 emissions than the poorest half of the world’s population. In order to address these challenges, there is an urgent need to fundamentally redirect the European Union towards a just and democratic climate transition. Several recent European initiatives in response to the climate crisis, the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine have begun to guide EU policies in that direction (the Green Deal, RRF, SURE, etc.). This initiative proposes that these ecological and social transition policies be shored up over the long term through the establishment, on the initiative of the European Commission, of a tax on great wealth . A number of studies, including the one carried out recently by the World Inequality Lab, have shown that such a tax would help to speed up the fight against climate change and inequality. It would contribute to the European Union’s own resources, generating revenue that would enable the EU to co-finance the ecological and social transition policies pursued by the Union and its Member States, taking account of their objective situation. The creation of a European tax on great wealth would be a response to many calls from civil society, scientists and elected representatives . Recently, more than a hundred MEPs, supported by economists, called on the Union to establish a progressive tax on extremely high levels of wealth. The future directive on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation for multinationals in the Union has already shown that the EU is capable of reaching an agreement to increase tax equity. More generally, the Conference on the future of Europe emphasised the need to harmonise tax policy, using it as a tool to combat the environmental crisis. The introduction of a European tax on great wealth would require three legislative measures. First of all, we call on the European Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive on a European tax on great wealth on the basis of Article 115 TFEU. That Article allows the Council, acting unanimously, to issue directives for the approximation of national laws, in particular in the field of direct taxation, which directly affect the establishment or functioning of the internal market. National disparities in taxing the super-rich could fuel fiscal competition within the Union and create distortions in the internal market. Within the internal market, common strategic approaches and coordinated action are therefore needed in order to maximise the positive impact of taxing great wealth. We also call on the European Commission to propose an amendment to Council Decision 2020/2053 of 14 December 2020 on the system of own resources of the European Union, on the basis of the third paragraph of Article 311 TFEU. The purpose of such an amendment would be to enable the European tax on great wealth to contribute to the system of own resources of the European Union . Such an amendment would, moreover, be a response to the manifest intention of the European institutions since 2020 to add new sources of revenue, in particular with a view to funding the repayment of the financial commitments entered into by the Commission to finance the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). Finally, the new funding derived from a tax on great wealth should be used for a just ecological and social transition, feeding the policies of the Union and the Member States dedicated to this purpose. We therefore call on the European Commission to put forward proposals for measures in order to strengthen the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the funds linked to the Green Deal and cohesion policy. This will include amending the provisions underlying these funds, namely Regulations 2021/1056 and 2021/241 respectively and should be done through cohesion policy (third paragraph of Article 175 TFEU). Other legal bases could also potentially be used for this purpose, such as the provisions on the environment (Article 192(1) TFEU), employment and social policy (Articles 149 and 153 TFEU) and development cooperation policy (Article 209 TFEU).",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000006_en,11/07/2023,09/10/2023,09/10/2024,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""11/07/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""09/10/2023""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""09/10/2024""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""29/10/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":3},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","166,576.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Oxfam Deutschland"",""date"":""09/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""29,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""FEPS"",""date"":""09/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""24,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Oxfam Italia"",""date"":""09/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""30,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Oxfam Novib"",""date"":""09/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""2,200""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Oxfam Sverige"",""date"":""08/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""3,500""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Oxfam EU Advocacy Office"",""date"":""07/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""26,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Oxfam Intermon"",""date"":""07/10/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""1,800""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Europa-Nævnet"",""date"":""01/01/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""42,884""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASBL Fonsoc"",""date"":""07/06/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""956""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASBL Fonsoc"",""date"":""01/06/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""247""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASBL Fonsoc"",""date"":""25/04/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""4,786""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASBL Fonsoc"",""date"":""07/06/2023"",""amount_in_eur"":""956""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""ASBL Fonsoc"",""date"":""01/06/2023"",""amount_in_eur"":""247""}]","357,155","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,286"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""32.00%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""13,942"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""94.17%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""227"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""1.89%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""424"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""5.01%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""113"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""2.67%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""873"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""5.90%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""10,473"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""106.11%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""186"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""3.77%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,404"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""34.49%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""111,106"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""199.49%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""110,205"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""162.83%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,619"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""10.94%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,680"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""11.35%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,451"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""15.83%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""33,665"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""62.83%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""182"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""3.23%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""260"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""3.35%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,256"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""29.69%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""64"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""1.51%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""11,078"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""54.18%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,691"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""4.61%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,034"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""6.98%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,477"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""6.35%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""6,620"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""67.07%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,767"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""31.33%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""29,564"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""71.08%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""8,508"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""57.47%""}}",3,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.261199,2025-12-15T19:12:43.262593
2023/000007,"Preservation and development of Ukrainian culture, education, language, and traditions in EU states","The aggression of Russia has resulted in over 5 million Ukrainians being forced to seek refuge on the territory of EU countries. The surveys among Ukrainian refugees indicate that approximately 40 percent plan to stay in EU countries rather than return to Ukraine. Despite efforts made by the EU institutions, there are still challenges ahead in successfully integrating Ukrainian citizens into the societies where they temporarily reside while preserving their culture, traditions, and language in EU countries.
               

                We believe it is essential for the EU to take additional actions in supporting Ukrainian refugees. The Commission could propose legislation based on Article 167 TFEU, focusing on national and regional diversity and cultural heritage.
               

                The initiative aims to bridge cultural gaps and empower Ukrainian cultural and linguistic heritage in the EU community, fostering a sense of belonging and promoting integration for Ukrainian refugees. We can work towards a more inclusive and harmonious Europe by recognizing and embracin","The issue of Ukrainian refugees regarding the preservation of culture, language, traditions, and heritage, as well as integration and mutual understanding, is well understood in the EU, where significant steps have already been taken to address it and establish the necessary legislative framework. On March 21, 2022, an extraordinary meeting of the General Assembly of the European Federation of National Language Institutions (EFNIL) took place, during which the members unanimously supported Ukraine's membership in the linguistic space of the EU. This decision allows for the formulation of a legislative strategy to protect the Ukrainian language as a future language of the EU. On May 18, 2023, the Ukrainian language was officially included in the European Commission's eTranslation system. This free online tool enables the translation of texts and official documents among all 24 EU languages. It is now possible to translate EU legislative acts from English to Ukrainian, facilitating faster analysis and implementation. Conversely, Ukrainian legislation can now be translated into the languages of EU countries. This is an important strategic step for Ukraine, which will contribute to negotiations regarding EU membership. All official EU languages are already in eTranslation, and Ukrainian is now among them. Furthermore, Ukraine became a candidate for EU membership on June 23, 2022, and is actively working on fulfilling the requirements for full accession to the EU. Thus, there are all grounds for the full integration of Ukrainian citizens into the European community while preserving their national identity and uniqueness. Based on Article 167, paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the principles of EU multilingualism, we hereby propose the official European Citizens' Initiative titled ""On the preservation and development of Ukrainian culture, education, language, and traditions in EU countries”. This initiative aims to preserve and develop Ukrainian culture, education, language, and traditions in EU countries. As members of the initiative group, we advocate for several activities which should be done and the establishment of information centers, tentatively named ""Integration and Development Center of Ukrainian Culture and Language in EU Countries 'We Are Together'"", in EU countries with a Ukrainian refugee population of no less than 10,000 individuals. These centers should be established with financial support and under the auspices of European Union structures. The objectives of these centers are as follows: Provide consultations and assistance, including legal and psychological support, to facilitate the integration of Ukrainian refugees into their new host countries while preserving their national and linguistic identities. Establish optional classes and educational programs that provide intensive Ukrainian language instruction for both children and adults, including EU citizens, at integration and development centers. Conduct classes on Ukrainian culture, history, and its interconnectedness with the histories of EU countries and the host country. Support and preserve the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. Encourage non-commercial cultural exchanges among Ukrainian refugees residing in different EU countries and foster interaction with the local population. Promote and support the arts, literature, music, and other creative forms among Ukrainian refugees, including the audiovisual arts, integrating them into the broader European cultural space. By implementing these measures, the EU will strive to strengthen the cultural and linguistic ties between Ukrainian refugees and the host countries, ensuring their integration and contributing to the diverse cultural landscape of Europe.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000007_en,16/08/2023,13/02/2024,13/02/2025,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""16/08/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""13/02/2024""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""13/02/2025""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""15/05/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Latvia"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,"1,095","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""54"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""0.40%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""48"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.32%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""16"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.13%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""12"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.10%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""14"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.16%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""30"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.30%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""148"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""0.27%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""177"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.26%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""82"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.55%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""30"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.20%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""31"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.34%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""120"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.22%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.20%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""16"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""1"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.02%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""3"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.07%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""59"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.29%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""64"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.17%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""26"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""32"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""15"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.15%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""48"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""21"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.14%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.342523,2025-12-15T19:12:43.343763

By promoting public transit, reducing congestion, and empowering passengers, this initiative advances sustainable ur","Subject of the Initiative: This initiative addresses the need to enhance passenger experience and mobility within the European Union's public transportation network. The focus is on improving access to real-time information at bus stops to alleviate uncertainties faced by passengers regarding bus schedules, operational status, delays, and alternatives. Objectives of the Initiative: The initiative aims to achieve the following objectives: Enhanced Passenger Experience: Provide passengers with accurate and up-to-date information about bus schedules, routes, delays, and operational status through the implementation of standardized QR codes at all bus stops. Reduced Uncertainty: Alleviate passenger uncertainties related to the availability and timeliness of buses, enabling informed decisions and smoother travel experiences. Promote Sustainable Mobility: Encourage the use of public transportation by providing transparent and reliable real-time information, contributing to reduced congestion, emissions, and environmental impact. Digital Integration: Align with the EU's Digital Single Market strategy by leveraging modern technology (QR codes) to facilitate access to information, fostering seamless digital services for passengers. Transparency and Accessibility: Ensure transparency and accessibility of transportation services, empowering passengers with accurate and consistent information, regardless of location or language. Background to the Initiative: In the context of a globalized, modern, and sustainable Europe, effective transportation systems are crucial for citizen mobility and economic development. However, passengers often face uncertainties, leading to inconvenience and inefficiency. Uncertainties related to operational status, delays, and bus availability can disrupt travel plans, hinder time management, and result in missed opportunities. While live status monitors are present at major stations and hubs, the majority of bus stops lack such provisions. This gap in information accessibility negatively impacts passengers' ability to make informed decisions about their journeys. This initiative recognizes the need to extend the benefits of real-time information to all bus stops, irrespective of their size or frequency of use. To address these challenges, the initiative underscores the importance of transparency and up-to-date information as essential components of a modern and efficient transportation network. Passengers need reliable information to plan their journeys effectively, optimize their travel options, and make informed decisions. By providing passengers with immediate access to real-time information through QR codes at bus stops, this initiative seeks to ensure that public transportation becomes a more reliable, transparent, and user-centric service. The initiative aligns with the EU's commitment to sustainable mobility, efficient transportation, and technological innovation. By reducing uncertainties, promoting sustainable travel choices, and enhancing digital integration, the initiative contributes to the goals of enhancing the passenger experience, fostering greener transportation, and advancing the EU's digital agenda. In summary, this initiative addresses a critical need for improving public transportation accessibility, transparency, and convenience within the European Union.

                We urge the European Commission to propose a recommendation as to propose the legal act for Members of State on the definition of informed consent, promoting the primacy of human dignity, freedom, and bodily autonomy within the European Union.
               





                 2: Enhancing Transparency and Empowering Citizens
                


                We request the EC to introduce a legal act that enhances transparency and access to information in EU decision-making processes.","We, the undersigned citizens from seven EU Member States, are calling upon the European Commission to enact legislation that fosters freedom, transparency, accountability, and individual engagement within the European Union. Our aim is to establish and strengthen checks and balances, ensuring that EU institutions are responsive to the needs and interests of the individuals while upholding our human rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. These are: Human Dignity, the Right to Life, the Right to Integrity of the Person, Prohibition of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Right to Liberty and Security, Respect for Private and Family Life, Protection of Personal Data, Freedom of Thought, Conscience, and Religion, Freedom of Expression and Information, Freedom of Assembly and Association. We urge the European Commission to uphold the moral and spiritual heritage enshrined in the preamble of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights by promoting indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality, and solidarity, fostering democracy, the rule of law, and prioritizing the individual through Union citizenship and a zone of freedom, security, and justice. 1: Upholding Human Dignity and the Recognition of Informed Consent We urge the European Commission to propose a recommendation as to propose the legal act for Members of State on the definition of informed consent, promoting the primacy of human dignity, freedom, and bodily autonomy within the European Union. This legal act should prioritize the following key principles: 1. Respect for Individual Autonomy and Integrity: Promote the fundamental principles of individual autonomy, integrity, and the prohibition of inhumane and degrading treatment within medical contexts. Recognize that informed consent means that every individual has the right to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare and treatment options for them and their children. 2. Preservation of Free Consent in all Circumstances: Free consent is crucial both in research (clinical trials) and treatment contexts, even during emergencies. These fundamental principles cannot be suspended, for whatever reason. No exceptions are admitted. Informed consent should be freely given without undue pressure or coercion. 3. Provision of Accurate, Understandable, and Accessible Information: Patients must be provided with accurate and accessible information about their medical conditions, available treatments, and potential risks and benefits. Transparent communication between healthcare professionals and patients is essential. 4. Comprehensive Understanding of Clinical Trials and Medical Procedures: Patients should fully understand the nature, purpose, risks, and potential benefits of clinical trials, medical procedures, or treatments to make well-informed decisions. 5. Recognizing the Right to Refuse or Withdraw Consent: Individuals have the right to refuse or withdraw consent at any point in their medical journey without facing unwarranted pressure or coercion. Healthcare providers should respect and honor patients' decisions. 2: Enhancing Transparency and Empowering Citizens We request the European Commission to introduce a legal act that enhances transparency and access to information in EU decision-making processes: 1. Mandating greater transparency by calling for the publication of agendas, meeting minutes, internal reports, e-mails, and SMS. 2. Disclosing lobbying activities by establishing a public register of lobbyists names (not just organizations) and their interactions with EU officials. 3. Prohibiting secretive meetings: EU officials should not participate alone in secret and secretive meetings; representatives of citizens and local, national, and European parliamentarians should be present. 4. Evaluating public interest over private interest: Mechanisms should be set up to evaluate the prevalence of public interest over private interest, especially concerning trade secrets that may affect public policy objectives like Public Health. 5. Establishing sanctions for violations: Effective sanctions and penalties should be put in place for EU officials who violate these rules. ************** By implementing these proposals, we strive to strengthen democracy, protect human rights, and empower citizens within the European Union. Transparency, informed consent, and fundamental rights are crucial in ensuring that EU institutions work in the best interest of the people they represent.

2023/000010,'I'm Going European':  An ECI to Connect your National and European Citizenship,"This ECI demands a right for everyone, and not just the few, to have a basic knowledge about the EU and their European Citizenship from an early age. Being an active European citizen should be for everyone living in the EU. Only an inclusive approach will make European citizenship a real democratic citizenship. This is consistent with repeated resolutions of the European Parliament and recommendations from the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFoE).
               

                We ask the Commission to:
               

                ●Propose through participatory democracy practice a European law, under Article 25 TFEU, for all Member States to introduce a right for every child to education in European Citizenship and the values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law;
               

                ●Give everyone who desires it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put this knowledge to good use and explore what Europe has to offer;
               

                ●Back up this law by measures to:
               

                ○  introduce a European civic educ","BACKGROUND This European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) aims to ensure that from an early age everyone in the EU is equipped with the necessary competence and given the opportunity to take advantage of what Europe has to offer. It is high time to do so since this year marks the 30th anniversary of the introduction of Union citizenship in the Maastricht Treaty. A right to education about European citizenship is a critical enabling condition for the exercise of rights granted by the European Union; in other words, unless awareness about rights is guaranteed, the opportunity for their exercise remains limited. Furthermore, education about European citizenship is a way to bring the European Union closer to all of its citizens, mobile and non-mobile alike. In other words, it should not be that just by exercising freedom of movement, one is introduced to their European rights, but rather through education comprising all rights. We believe this would contribute towards increasing the resilience of communities and individual citizens to exposure to multiple forms of misinformation, giving an extra shield of protection against unfair practices or online disinformation campaigns. Civil Society Organisations and teachers have pointed repeatedly to the need to give more priority to civic education and close a gap between the rhetoric of the EU and actual practice, which is rare, scattered and highly variable across the 27 EU Member States The EU supports fine projects to create active European citizens, but if European citizenship has meaning, it should be known to all. With the rise of extremist and populist political parties, the urgency of quality European citizenship education in human rights and democracy has never been so apparent. Brexit has shown that European citizenship can also be lost and that the lack of awareness over this risk and citizens lacking basic information poses a real risk to our democracy. Therefore, education for EU citizenship has to be offered en masse. Young people and children deserve to know their European citizenship rights, and this should be guaranteed through Article 25 of TFEU which would allow to add a new right to European citizenship. If successful, this ECI will: ●Support efforts to give more priority to citizenship education; ●Help popularise the first transnational citizenship of the modern era by bringing it into the classroom and civil society; ●Ensure that the next generation has the skills, critical awareness, and the opportunity to bring about a more democratic Europe. ●Create a guarantee for children in the European Union that this will receive citizenship education, which would additionally help the next generation to develop skills, critical awareness, and the opportunity to navigate the complex challenges of the 21st century and support a more democratic Union; ●It will inspire a broader global dialogue on citizenship and children’s rights at a time when geopolitical and climate related challenges can make growing up in this world daunting. OUR PROPOSAL The Commission can act on these proposals under the Maastricht Treaty (1993) which added Treaty articles on Union Citizenship and the Lisbon Treaty (2007) which introduced the rights of the child. We demand: ●A proposal for a European law by which Member States would give every child a right to an age-appropriate education about the EU and European Citizenship. There is a precedent with a European guarantee to protect children against poverty. This ECI is more about promoting their interests and the guarantee would be elevated to the status of a right. The law should be brought in after widespread consultation of parents, teachers, civil society and above all children themselves. There should be extensive online consultation, local meetings and a European citizens’ assembly randomly selected to be representative. This process should define the right to access the European rights which make up European citizenship. A commitment to formal education should in no way diminish the role that non-formal EU citizenship education plays, which allows for a hands-on approach, and highly motivated engagement from students and trainers. Rather this proposal suggests expanding outreach bridging the gap between the two approaches to create an innovative approach to citizenship education in line with the 21st century (including through digital means). The European law should be based on the following principles: ●Union citizenship is additional to and in no way replaces national citizenship, so the European dimension should be added to the existing civic education courses and efforts in and out of school. Responsibility as to how to do this should be left to each country given their different approaches. What matters is the result. ●The latitude given to each country should be balanced by a requirement to provide the Commission and other Member States with information about their programmes and an assessment of the results. This should be carried out in terms of Article 25 TFEU every three years with the EU Citizenship Report.",Withdrawn,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000010_en,08/11/2023,,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""08/11/2023""},{""step"":""Withdrawn"",""date"":""09/04/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":2},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,,,,,Withdrawn,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.592201,2025-12-15T19:12:43.593482
2023/000011,Creation of a European Environment Authority,"The objective of this initiative is that the European Commission set up a European Environment Authority, either as the successor to the European Environment Agency, exercising official powers, or as a new authority
                

                . The European Environment Authority would be an independent, central EU environment authority with legal personality, which, for the effective functioning of the internal market, alongside the Member States’ national environment authorities, would take administrative decisions that are binding on Member States and natural and legal persons, i.e. businesses having their registered office or ownership in either the EU or a third country, whenever the environmental impact of Member States’ agricultural, industrial or service activities – at any stage of those activities, including waste management and recycling – extends beyond national borders and occurs at EU level.
               

                The European Environment Authority would authorise and supervise activities that have an environmental impact and act in cases of environmenta","Under the European Green Deal, the European Union set itself the goals of ensuring no net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, economic growth decoupled from resource use, and no person and no place left behind. The European Commission’s proposals aim to make all sectors of the EU’s economy fit to meet this challenge and set the EU on a path to reach its climate targets for 2030 in a fair, cost-effective and competitive way. The European Commission has taken measures in areas such as sustainable transport for all, pollution-free energy systems, more environmentally friendly buildings, the creation of a global climate policy and the protection of nature and human health. Given that the EU is striving to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent, this social and economic transformation will inevitably involve the spreading of new, complex technologies and the emergence of new, complex environmental impacts on the entire Union. For example, under the European Green Deal, the production of batteries, which are essential for operating electric vehicles, will increase sharply in all EU Member States by 2050. Moreover, any business having its registered office or ownership in the EU or a third country that builds a battery factory in a Member State will meet the factory’s increased demand for water from natural sources (rivers and lakes) that may extend across several EU Member States, while CO2 emissions can also be expected to increase. This could lead to harmful substances appearing in other Member States, by being released into the air or water, leaking into the groundwater, or through waste disposal. This initiative seeks to create an authority responsible for preventing environmental pollution at EU level that has the latest environmental expertise and, alongside the Member States’ national environment authorities, takes binding administrative decisions whenever the environmental impact of Member States’ agricultural, industrial or service activities extends beyond national borders and occurs at EU level. Examples of environmental impacts and pollution at EU level where the European Environment Authority could take action include the following: Transboundary air pollution: Due to winds, harmful substances emitted in one EU Member State may affect the air quality of another Member State. For example, industrial emissions or transport pollution from one Member State may cause smog or acid rain in nearby Member States. Water pollution: Pollution may affect several Member States where there are transboundary rivers or lakes, since agricultural run-off, industrial emissions or harmful substances emitted by waste water treatment plants in one Member State may pollute transboundary bodies of water, which may impact the Member States that lie downstream. Marine pollution: Marine pollution in coastal Member States may impact their neighbouring Member States. Emissions from ships, oil spills and illegal waste dumping can lead to the pollution of coastal waters shared by several Member States. Soil contamination: The cross-border transport of harmful substances, such as chemicals or waste, entails a risk of soil contamination in the event of an accident or improper handling, which could affect the soil quality and agriculture of the Member State where the accident occurs. Noise pollution: Noise pollution from airports, motorways and industrial plants located in the vicinity of borders can affect the quality of life and health of residents of neighbouring Member States, as noise knows no political borders. Transboundary waste management: The improper disposal of waste, including hazardous waste, in one Member State can also have a cross-border environmental impact, if the waste crosses the border illegally or pollutes the groundwater. Climate change: Differences in levels of greenhouse gas emissions among EU Member States can cause disparities in the effects of climate change. Countries with higher emissions can contribute towards global warming, which affects all Member States through climate change, rising sea levels and other factors. The European Environment Authority would be an independent central authority that would act on its own initiative or following a complaint, and would be responsible for authorising and supervising activities having a cross-border environmental impact at EU level. In the event of environmental pollution at EU level, it would penalise the polluter by prohibiting the polluting activity, restoring the baseline condition, imposing fines in proportion to the pollution, and so on, in line with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. This could help prevent Member States and businesses from engaging in activities that endanger the life and health of EU citizens and are harmful to the environment as a result of the decisions of Member States’ national environment authorities, which lack the specific, latest expertise on the environmental impact of complex industrial, agricultural and service activities, and, depending on their administrative structure, often take decisions at local or municipal level.",Unsuccessful collection,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2023/000011_en,08/11/2023,10/01/2024,10/01/2025,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""08/11/2023""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""10/01/2024""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""10/01/2025""},{""step"":""Unsuccessful collection"",""date"":""12/04/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Hungary"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","20,119.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Momentum Mozgalom"",""date"":""15/01/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""9,969""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Renew Europe Group"",""date"":""15/01/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""10,150""}]","14,764","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""295"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""2.20%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""213"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.44%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""22"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""32"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.38%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""36"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""39"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.40%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""6"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.12%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""107"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""1.08%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""689"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""1.24%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""811"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""1.20%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""95"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.64%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""10,701"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""72.28%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""40"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.44%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""597"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""1.11%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""5"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.09%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""18"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.23%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.26%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.19%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""238"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""1.16%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""113"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.31%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""124"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.84%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""129"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.55%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""38"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.39%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""37"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""272"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.65%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""78"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.53%""}}",0,,Unsuccessful Collection,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.680680,2025-12-15T19:12:43.681923
2024/000001,Ban on conversion practices in the European Union,"We call on the European Commission to propose a binding legal ban on conversion practices targeting LGBTQ+ citizens in the European Union:
               

                Conversion Practices are interventions aimed at changing, repressing or suppressing the sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression of LGBTQ+ persons.
               

                Such practices, due to their discriminatory, degrading, harmful and fraudulent nature have been qualified as torture by the United Nations, and are currently being banned in a growing number of States.
               

                The EU plays a key role in the protection of fundamental rights and should take actions to fight against all inhuman practices. The Commission should propose a directive adding conversion practices to the list of euro-crimes and/or amend the ongoing directive on equality (2008) to include a ban on these practices.
               

                Furthermore, to fight against the legislative moratorium, the Commission should also enforce a non-binding resolution calling for a widespread ","I - Definition of conversion practices Conversion practices on LGBTQ+ people are comprised of a diverse group of mental and physical manipulations, psycho-hypnotic indoctrinations (usually presented to public as “therapies”), medical and homoeopathic interventions, exorcism and other treatments enacted with the aim of altering Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression. Such practices are based on two erroneous premises: first, that sexual orientation and gender identity is necessarily a choice, the result of some esoteric evil power, or an outright disease, and second, that it can be suppressed, changed or cured. Both academic literature and policy documents of international organisations often refer to such conversion practices as “conversion therapies” or “reparative therapies”, especially when under the disguise of seemingly professional counselling by psychologists or psychiatrists. According to the “Report on conversion therapy by the United Nations independent expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity” (2020), conversion practices are “deeply harmful interventions that rely on the medically false idea that LGBTQ+ people are sick, inflicting severe pain and suffering, and resulting in long-lasting psychological and physical damage”. II - Facts and figures Though there is little available data on conversion practices, we can still rely on a number of reports The “National LGBT Survey” in the UK (2017) reveals that 5% of respondents have been offered conversion in an attempt to “cure” them of being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) during their lifetime; 2% reported that they had undergone conversion therapy; 4% of transgender respondents have undergone conversion therapy, and 8% reported having been offered it. The report “Unga hbtq-personers utsatthet för omvändelseförsök i Sverige” (Sweden, 2022), estimates that 16% of LGBTQ+ Youth have felt pressured to change their identity and 5% have been exposed to other forms of threats or harm. In 2019, the William Institute estimated that around 700 000 US citizens have undergone conversion practices. These figures show that the situation varies from one country to another, and therefore any general estimate has to be taken into account with caution. Nevertheless, based on the available data we can roughly calculate that 5% of LGBTQ+ EU citizens have been pressured to undergo conversion practices. III - Recommendations for a ban on conversion practices The report on “Conversion Practices on LGBT+ People” requested by the LIBE committee, published in July 2023 makes the following recommendations for lawmakers on what a ban on conversion practices should include: - Provide a clear, precise and comprehensive definition of conversion practices, which shall cover all practices that seek to change, repress or suppress a person's sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression ; - Prohibit the offering, advertising, and performance of conversion practices in all settings, irrespective of the settings in which conversion practices are carried out or of the perpetrator or the promoter, so to cover health-care, religious, educational, community, commercial or any other setting, public or private; - The prohibition shall be implemented and enforced through criminal and/or civil or administrative law; - Laws should provide for appropriate, proportionate and dissuasive penalties and sanctions , based on the acts of torture and inhumane treatment and their gravity, the victims involved and the harm caused - The ban should particularly protect children, young people and vulnerable adults from conversion practices, by taking special prevention and protection measures; - Consent should be deemed irrelevant in relation to the ban on conversion practices, due to its dubious nature in this context, both for children and for adults; - The offering or provision of conversion practices by health professionals, the involvement of minors or vulnerable adults and any financial remuneration should be considered as aggravating circumstances . This should result in severe consequences, such as the withdrawal of licences, termination of public funding, and the closure of establishments offering such ‘practices’. In cases involving minors, parental responsibility and authority should be examined closely to ensure their well-being and protection; - Claims related to conversion practices should be promptly investigated, leading to prosecution and appropriate punishment for offenders. Victims of conversion practices should be provided with legal, medical, and psychological assistance as well as support. They should have access to justice, including avenues for redress, reparations and rehabilitation; public funds shall not be used, to support conversion practices; - National human rights institutions, ombudsmen and equality bodies shall be competent in countering conversion practices, while media and education campaigns shall be launched. Data shall be collected on the magnitude of conversion practices in the national territory; - Laws and regulations that enable, promote or fuel conversion practices shall be repealed, particularly those that criminalise LGBT+ persons. Anti-discrimination measures and campaigns shall take their place to promote equality and ensure protection from violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; - Member States, should implement the above recommendations and introduce bans on conversion practices . If they have already enacted such bans , they should review them to ensure that they are in conformity with the above recommendations, stemming from recommendations made by the UN and the CoE.",Valid initiative,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000001_en,24/01/2024,17/05/2024,17/05/2025,16/06/2025,17/11/2025,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""24/01/2024""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""17/05/2024""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""17/05/2025""},{""step"":""Verification"",""date"":""16/06/2025""},{""step"":""Valid initiative"",""date"":""17/11/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""France"":1}}","{""name"":""ACT (Against Conversion Therapy)"",""country_of_residence"":""France""}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":2},""members"":{""number_of_people"":8},""others"":{""number_of_people"":3},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,"1,128,063","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""10,724"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""80.06%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""47,459"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""320.56%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,386"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""19.91%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""8,574"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""101.35%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""696"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""16.45%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,774"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""25.49%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""8,587"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""87.00%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,519"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""30.78%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""23,618"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""239.29%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""580,568"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""1,042.41%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""92,739"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""137.03%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,127"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""27.88%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,195"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""21.58%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""18,503"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""201.89%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""60,701"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""113.29%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,103"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""19.56%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,973"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""25.44%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,091"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""49.43%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""861"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""20.35%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""38,112"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""186.41%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""9,039"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""24.66%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""9,025"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""60.96%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""9,932"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""42.69%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,671"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""27.06%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""6,400"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""113.48%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""162,018"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""389.51%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""17,668"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""119.34%""}}",10,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:43.765843,2025-12-15T19:12:43.767569

The economic and social importance of farmers, breeders, fishermen and other representatives of the primary sector is not sufficiently recognized. Agricultural production and rural land suffer from speculative movements which force farmers to replace their agricultural land by other industries which do not serve the objective of food security. A new, protective legislative framework is needed, revolving around the following axes: priority use of agricultural land for food production; guarantee of food sovereignty and security; addressing food chain issues and high prices; ensure access for farmers and rural communities to infrastructure and transport, financing, digitalization, work, entrepreneurship and education. 2.Improve water management to support food security and establish a European Hydrological Plan Farmers, as stewards of the land, know better than anyone that healthy and rich water and soil are essential to the rural economy. Irrigated land plays a crucial role in food production, enabling farmers to cultivate crops in areas that would otherwise be unsuitable for agriculture due to aridity or irregular rainfall patterns. The Water Framework Directive published in 2000 has not delivered in its attempt to require Member States to invest in clean rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater. The lack of a functioning public water infrastructure to prevent pollution is an evil that affects the entire EU and that is why we need a European Hydrological Plan that guarantees the supply and distribution of water between all the territories of the Union. 3.Establish a European Agency for Agriculture and Rural Economy The EU needs a permanent European authority in form of a EU Agency or high-level consultative Committee to monitor and observe the protection of Agriculture and Rural Economy in the EU decision-making process. This Agency or Committee shall have a permanent nature and operate to ensure that the agriculture and rural economy rights and interests are observed.

2024/000003,EUROPEAN CANNABIS INITIATIVE,"We call on the European Commission to:
                 





                  Convene a Transeuropean Citizens' Assembly about cannabis policies in a larger perspective on: a common scale of sanctions throughout the EU; the consistency of the Member States’ policies; EU citizens’ opportunity to discuss among themselves and with the Institutions on this sensitive subject.
                 





                  Foster access to medical cannabis based on scientific evidence and the experiences of patients, and to allow patients the transportation of cannabis and any of its derivatives prescribed for therapeutic uses throughout the EU in order to ensure the full enjoyment of the right to health.
                 





                  Allocate the necessary resources for researching cannabis – including in herbal and traditional medicine – for its therapeutic uses and to share them internationally.","The European Union has progressively adopted common positions on innovative approaches to human right-centred drug policies, a stance reflected in its participation in relevant United Nations meetings. At the same time, several EU Member States like Malta, Luxembourg and Germany have pursued significant changes in their national policies that deal with non-medical and non-scientific use of cannabis. Since 1990s non-commercial Cannabis Social Clubs have been operating in Spain elsewhere, like in Portugal, Greece and Italy, personal use has been depanelized. Changes in national approaches have often been promoted by civil society with the final objective to protect public health and to ensure the full respect of the human rights of users -an estimated 52 million people in the EU- as well as to have an impact on the hundreds of thousands of detainees that populate European prisons so much that the European Court of Human Rights has adopted several sentences to denounce inhumane and degrading treatments as a result of the overcrowding. Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA, laid down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties on illicit drug trafficking; after 20 years that document is no longer in line with the latest developments in the field of drug control and does not reflect recent international and national recommendations that include: ·The report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights “Human rights challenges in addressing and countering all aspects of the world drug problem”; ·the UN human rights experts' statement published on June 26, 2022; ·the UN system common position supporting the implementation of the international drug control policy through effective inter-agency collaboration; ·the decision of the UN Commission of Narcotic Drugs that in December 2020 deleted the cannabis plant from schedule IV of the 1961 UN Convention; ·the outcome document of the UN General Assembly on Drugs (UNGASS) of 2016. This ECI is in line with the growing international concerns that in October 2022 mandated the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) to draft a “General Comment” by 2024 that should address the impact of drug policies on economic, social and cultural rights. In April 2020, CESCR adopted General Comment 25 where one paragraph is entirely dedicated to controlled substances with particular attention to cannabis: […]Scientific research is impaired for some substances under the international conventions on drug control, as these substances are classified as harmful for health and with no scientific or medical value. However, some of these classifications were made with insufficient scientific support to substantiate the decision, as credible evidence exists regarding the medical uses of a number of them, such as cannabis for the treatment of certain epilepsies. Thus, States Parties should harmonize the fulfillment of their obligations under the international drug control regime with their obligations to respect, protect and fulfill the [right to participate and to enjoy the benefits from scientific progress and its applications,] RPEBSPA, through a regular revision of its policies in relation to controlled substances. Furthermore, the 2023 report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends, among other things: ·the adoption of alternatives to criminalization, “zero tolerance” and elimination of drugs, by considering decriminalization of usage; and take control of illegal drug markets through responsible regulation, to eliminate profits from illegal trafficking, criminality and violence; ·the review convictions and/or sentences and, where appropriate, quash, commute, or reduce convictions and/or sentences. Crucial to the EU strategy on drugs is the so-called effective inter-agency collaboration, as well as the International Guidelines on Human Rights and Drug Policy, that take into account the respective competences of the EU and individual Member States. The EU Strategy on Drugs takes into account policy developments at multilateral level and contributes to the acceleration of their implementation. The EU supported the outcome document of the 2016 UNGASS, which is the most comprehensive policy document in that respect adopted at the international level to this date. The EU also supports the 2019 Ministerial Declaration adopted at the UN. All these public statements have not been translated into policies that have incorporated those human rights concerns. The lack of significant progress in the containment of illicit narcotics around Europe imposes a radical rethinking of the approach that for decades has not reduced drug demand and supply. There is no evidence that toughening penalties has brought about a more effective European drugs control system, while it has constructed resources to reduce the risks and/or harms connected to problematic drugs use.

2024/000004,"My Voice, My Choice: For Safe And Accessible Abortion","The “My Voice, My Choice” campaign offers the people of Europe the chance to make women's lives freer, safer, and better; wherever they live in our union, whatever conditions they may find themselves in.
               


                 The lack of access to abortion in many parts of Europe not only puts women at risk of physical harm but also puts undue economic and mental stress on women and families, often on the margins of society that can afford it the least.
                


                It has been well documented that treating reproductive care as a luxury does not reduce abortions, it simply drives women to seek unsafe abortions.
               


                 To change this we are asking the European Commission to - in the spirit of solidarity - submit a proposal for financial support to Member States that would be able to perform safe termination of pregnancies for anyone in Europe who still lacks access to safe and legal abortion.
                


                Countless lives and livelihoods are ended, disrupted, and lost because of lack of access to safe ","With the “My Voice, My Choice” campaign we have an opportunity to make Europe more fair, more free, and more equal. Currently, the lack of access to abortion as basic women’s healthcare in many parts of Europe not only puts women at risk of physical harm but also puts undue economic and mental stress on women, often in marginalised communities that can afford it the least . There is strong consensus among scientific and International Bodies that treating reproductive care as a luxury does not reduce abortions, it simply leads women to seek unsafe abortion s. Countless lives, livelihoods, and communities are ended, disrupted, and lost because of these dangerous practices. With this European Citizens' Initiative, we will move to a more just policy that expresses our European values more concretely and compassionately. OUR INITIATIVE We are asking the Commission to submit a proposal for financial support to Member States that would be able to perform safe termination of pregnancies, in accordance with their domestic law, for anyone in Europe who still lacks access to safe and legal abortion. This solution could take the form of an opt-in mechanism open to Member States on a voluntary basis. Those who would opt-in would then receive financial support from the EU to compensate for the weight of this solidarity effort. Our initiative does not aim to harmonise nor interfere with the laws and regulations of Member States, but rather falls under the supporting competence of the EU , in accordance with the rules set up by the European treaties. PREVENTING UNSAFE ABORTION IS A PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER IN WHICH THE EU CAN INTERVENE According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU: “ the Union shall take into account requirements linked to […] [the] protection of human health ” ( article 9 ), and “ may also adopt incentive measures designed to protect and improve human health ” ( article 168 ). The EU enshrined the protection of human health in article 3 of its Charter of Fundamental Rights, setting that: “ Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity ”. These norms lay ground for tangible actions, such as the recognition of a principle of non-discrimination with regard to the nationality of patients ( Directive (EU) No 2011/24 ), and therefore introduce an equal right to access healthcare in any Member State. Also based on article 168 , the EU recently adopted the EU4Health program, setting up a €5.3 billion investment to achieve goals for better health in Europe, including “ supporting Member States’ actions to promote access to sexual and reproductive healthcare ” ( Regulation (EU) No 282/2014 ). Despite all these measures, many women in Europe do not have access to a safe and legal abortion and their health remains in jeopardy . At this stage, the status quo of EU legislation and policies highlights the need for European action to provide better protection for women’s health, including access to safe and legal abortions, and demonstrates that there is a path for an adequate solution at a regional level. PREVENTING UNSAFE ABORTIONS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER IN WHICH THE EU MUST INTERVENE TO UPHOLD ITS VALUES AND OBJECTIVES According to the Treaty on the EU: “ The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity [...] , equality [...] , respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities” ( article 2 ). Moreover, “ the Union's aim is to promote the well-being of its peoples [...] , combat social exclusion and discrimination ( article 3 ), “ eliminate inequalities, and promote equality, between men and women .” ( article 8 ). The inability to access a safe and legal abortion has the direct consequences of restricting women’s rights, such as self-determination, physical and mental integrity, education and work. The restriction of such rights reduces women to their procreative role and creates discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the Charter. “ Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected .” as provided for by article 1 of the Charter. For a woman, having to choose between carrying an unwanted pregnancy, thus threatening her mental health, or having an unsafe procedure, and threatening her physical health, can only be seen as a violation of her human dignity. The prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is guaranteed in article 4 of the Charter. According to the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, when a woman is denied safe abortions and subjected to humiliating and judgmental attitudes in such contexts of extreme vulnerability and where timely health care is essential, it may “ amount to torture or ill-treatment ” ( A/HRC/31/57 ). The right to equality and non-discrimination is protected by article 21 of the Charter. “ In countries where induced abortion is highly restricted by law or unavailable due to other barriers, safe abortion has often become the privilege of the rich, while poor women have little choice but to resort to the services of unskilled providers in unsafe settings or induce abortion themselves often using unsafe methods, leading to deaths and morbidities ” concludes the WHO. Therefore, women who lack access to safe and legal abortions are deprived of many of their fundamental rights and thus reduced to second-class citizens. * We, the citizens of the EU, want to make women’s lives substantially and materially better wherever they live in our Union, whatever conditions they find themselves in. It was stated by the President of the European Commission that their task is “ to provide full support to Member States’ efforts in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals relevant to women’s health, universal access to sexual reproductive care, family planning, and education .” ( Ares (2019) 6127222 ) Our initiative aims to make these promises a reality and to create a safer and more just Europe that works for everyone.",Valid

2024/000005,Save the Planet by shifting taxation from labour to greenhouse gas emissions,"With this initiative, we ask the Commission:
               




                 to strengthen the Fit for 55 Package, with a view to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045.
                



                 to strengthen the EU carbon pricing system (ETS) by setting a faster phase-out of free allowances (2030) and allowing an uncapped carbon price also of heating or transport sectors as necessary to achieve emissions reductions goals.
                



                 To redistribute a substantial part of carbon pricing revenues to low-income households, shifting taxation from labour to the consumption of non-renewable resources, strengthening the EU’s social climate fund.
                



                 to globally promote the establishment of a “Climate Club” where all participant countries adopt robust carbon pricing, with due consideration of redistributing carbon pricing revenues to low-income households.","Explanatory annex Global warming is a global challenge and an environmental and economic emergency,. The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service states that the atmospheric temperature in 2020 was already 1.25°C above the pre-industrial period. And calculations by the experts contributing to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) show that a global warming of 1.5°C can be expected as early as 2030. The EU's target of net zero by 2050 is insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement and limit warming to 1.5°C.  Economists and institutions no longer doubt that carbon pricing, implemented as an Emissions Trading System, like the EU ETS, is the most efficient and effective way to reduce GHG emissions. Academics and experts have found that, to limit global warming in line with the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing must be expanded globally, with a price of at least $75 by 2030. According to a recent study, a fair green transition would require wealthy, high-emitting nations to phase-out all oil and gas production by 2034 while the poorest nations would have until 2050 to end production. Recently, many decisions have been taken by the EU Commission about reducing, or phasing out fossil fuels. In February 2023, the European Parliament formally approved a law to effectively ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the European Union from 2035. Moreover, in March 2023, the European Parliament adopted its position on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) and stated that all new buildings should be zero-emission from 2028. This transition will include the stop of any subsidy to natural gas boilers from 2024. This stop is significant since buildings account for 35% of gas consumption in the EU. These measures can be added to the commitment of EU countries to phase out fossil coal by 2030. Based on the latest happenings, recent studies, and the initiatives taken by the EU institutions, it is proposed that the European Parliament set clear pathways to accelerate the decarbonisation of our economy and exit from fossil fuels dependency by 2045. Despite all that, some EU governments and parts of the European Parliament mistakenly still see carbon pricing as an economic risk. A robust carbon pricing system, necessary to fight global warming, would lead to a significant and persistent fall in GHG emissions, but also to an increase in energy and materials prices. Related costs would disproportionately fall on low-income households requiring counterbalancing measures. For that free CO2 permits are still provided to energy-intensive industries, even for sectors for which evidence of carbon-leakage risks is weak. Some governments continue to provide billions of euros of subsidies to the fossil-fuels economy in the name of social welfare and economic competitiveness,. On the contrary, an even more robust carbon pricing system is needed, but redistributing carbon pricing revenues to Low-income households is necessary to reduce the economic costs of carbon pricing and to strengthen public support for an effective carbon pricing initiative,. This approach is vital for any carbon pricing system, such as ETS, and should be a main pillar of a future carbon pricing agreement (“Climate Club”) with global reach, to be urgently promoted world-wide. The Climate Club and the CBAM The climate club is a voluntary agreement between participating countries to undertake harmonized emissions reductions. The climate club would normally agree on an 'international minimum carbon price' along with a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) applicable to non-member countries. This CBAM mechanism, agreed for adoption by the EU, represents a 'penalty' on imports from non-members and is designed to put a price on the carbon emitted during the production of goods, ensuring that the carbon price of imports is equivalent to the one of domestic production. In this way countries with less stringent climate policies cannot gain an undue competitive advantage. For this reason, it is crucial that the European Union, holding the largest carbon pricing mechanism worldwide, strongly promotes the establishment of a climate club with a CBAM. The Climate Club is expected to establish a Global Incentive Fund, to which every country with current or historical per-capita CO2 emissions above the global average contributes with a proportional fee. The fund will be used to support sustainable initiatives in low-GDP countries. In poorer countries, fossil fuels are disproportionately consumed (relative to income) by richer citizens, whereas in rich countries fossil fuels are disproportionately consumed by poorer citizens. Studies demonstrated that, without any revenue distribution, the initial burden of the carbon tax would fall disproportionately on the poor in richer countries, while also falling unequally on the rich in countries with lower Gross Domestic Product. The involvement of countries with low GDP in the Climate Club could be promoted by the redistribution of carbon pricing revenues lump-sum to those countries that have a per-capita emission lower than the global average. Moreover, the revenues of the carbon pricing could be integrated by a second instrument: the global carbon incentive (GCI), for which every country in the club that emits more than the global average (today around 4.5 tons CO2 per capita) should pay annually into a global incentive fund, with the amount calculated by multiplying the excess emissions per capita by the population and the Global Carbon Incentive.",Withdrawn,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000005_en,13/05/2024,,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""13/05/2024""},{""step"":""Withdrawn"",""date"":""18/10/2024""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Italy"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,,,,,Withdrawn,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.126660,2025-12-15T19:12:44.127729
2024/000006,Air-Quotas,"We, citizens of Europe, who have become aware of the climate danger at the heart of the sixth extinction that is under way, call on the European Commission to set up a climate assembly leading to a citizens’ carbon quota mechanism in each country that will encourage businesses to decarbonise through consumer demand.
               

                The mechanism should cover all purchases of goods and services. It starts symbolically with a critical means of transport, air transport. The Air Quotas information campaign makes it possible to understand the trade mechanism between carbon deficits and surpluses based on a fair distribution that decreases from year to year in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Union’s announcement of a 55% reduction.
               

                The three phases of the climate assembly are a survey, formulation by citizens selected by lot, together with experts and elected representatives, and finally national referendums for implementation in each country. The initial focus on air transport, leading to a media campaign, could be used as a","Keeping the planet liveable, addressing concerns It is now acknowledged that the climate footprint of human action on the planet must be drastically reduced if the earth is to remain liveable within the natural absorption limits of greenhouse gases, which humanity is responsible for. According to European IPCC researchers grouped under Copernicus, global anthropogenic production is now 54 Gt (billion tonnes) of CO2 equivalent, of which 41 Gt of CO2 alone (the other gases are predominantly methane and nitrous oxide, estimated to be 31% more harmful and long-lasting than CO2). Between 2013 and 2022, natural absorption was 12 Gt/year by plants and forests and 10 Gt by oceans (according to the Global Carbon Project), but these 21 Gt will decrease to 16-18 Gt by 2050. If there are 8-9 billion of us by then, in order to achieve the balance the IPCC has shown is necessary, we will need to have reduced our footprint at global level to 2 t per capita a year from 6.75 today. There are major differences between the countries subject to counting since the Paris Agreement. France emits 9 t per capita a year (the 2023 report by France's High Climate Council estimated the French CO2e footprint at 604 Mt with a household contribution estimated by CITEPA at 400 Mt, the difference relating to imports of goods and services), whereas Germany is 12 t, Canada 18, the United States 20 and Romania at 6 t per capita a year. The IPCC points out that the planet will no longer be fit to live on unless we reduce the footprint to 2 t of CO2 by 2050. We need to move from 9 to 2, the Americans from 20 to 2, the Chinese from 6 to 2, the Africans from 3 to 2. How can we achieve this reduction? By relying on the European industrial quota mechanism, which has not produced results and led to the notorious VAT fraud that has cost Member States EUR 6 billion? By relying on the carbon tax advocated by Jean Tirole and neo-liberal economists? It is considered harmful to society and it has been shown to be ineffective in Sweden, where it has been in place for 30 years without reducing the carbon footprint (as it is only an incentive, with no real results)? By relying on massive investment estimated at several hundred billion per year, but still without a guarantee of success? The climate debates from February to April 2021 assessed and discussed all these scenarios, with advocates of each solution being invited to speak. This resulted in five efficiency criteria, showing that a carbon account is the best mechanism: 1- count all greenhouse gases, whether produced locally or imported; 2- ensure an annual reduction of at least 6% in France towards the 2050 climate balance, shown to be necessary by the IPCC (the percentages vary from country to country); 3- contribute to social justice; 4- involve all stakeholders, including public services and businesses; 5- opt for less coercive means, safeguarding freedom and acceptance. What is a carbon account? This mechanism is supported by 25 partners and supporters of the carbon account alliance. It has two pillars: proponents of the carbon account propose to provide each French person with 9 000 carbon points for the year (the French average of 9 000 kg CO2e) to ‘pay’ for the carbon content of all their purchases of goods and services. This allocation is renewed each year and reduced by 6% to reach 2 t in 2050. Carbon labelling is the other pillar, requiring each company to keep a carbon register (simplified accounts) that enables all goods and services to be invoiced with their carbon content from suppliers’ bills. It is precisely this generalised labelling that gives power back to consumers and requires companies to decarbonise if they want to retain customers. Managing disparities Those most addicted will become loss-making before the end of the year and will need a surplus. Local exchanges are needed to buy or sell surpluses, as the national carbon money supply must be respected. That is the social benefit of this mechanism: the possibility for the most frugal (often out of economic necessity) to make money from surpluses of this kind of universal carbon income. In line with Elinor Ostrom’s rules of the commons, the whole carbon currency is managed not by businesses or the state, but by an independent joint agency, as in the French social security system in 1945. This agency would have a broad range of tasks, including maintaining each person's carbon account, monitoring companies’ carbon balance sheets (obligation to balance revenue and expenditure as in a balance sheet), and keeping the customs nomenclature setting out import and export standards. It would have robust governance structures to prevent fraud. It would provide a pricing framework for carbon quota trading between individuals (carbon having no monetary value for businesses) and monitor the reduction of the carbon footprint of public services, which should also fall by 6% per year on average while taking into account health and education needs. It is also under the influence of Elinor Ostrom that regional rather than national exchanges would be proposed: she recommends multipolar ways of organising to be as close as possible to citizens. It is proposed to launch a campaign in 2024 on a carbon account for aviation, involving the most symbolic source of greenhouse gas – aircraft – even though their impact is only 5% of the EU’s total climate footprint. The annual allocation of the 450 million Europeans would start at 500 carbon points or kilos of CO2 in the first year.",Collection ongoing,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000006_en,19/06/2024,,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""19/06/2024""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""16/12/2024""},{""step"":""Collection ongoing"",""date"":null}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""France"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}","6,252.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Association pour l'emploi sans carbone"",""date"":""25/04/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""6,252""}]","7,273","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""155"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""1.16%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""257"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""1.74%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""24"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""0.28%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.19%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""20"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""44"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.45%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""0.22%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""76"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.77%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""5,116"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""9.19%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""477"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""0.70%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""26"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.18%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""41"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.28%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""38"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""329"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""0.61%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""8"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.14%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""0.13%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""23"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.54%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""9"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""135"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""77"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""0.21%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""33"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.22%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""47"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""0.20%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""11"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""0.11%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""17"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""0.30%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""194"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""0.47%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""70"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""0.47%""}}",0,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.210346,2025-12-15T19:12:44.211630
2024/000007,Stop Destroying Videogames,"This initiative calls to require publishers that sell or license videogames to consumers in the European Union (or related features and assets sold for videogames they operate) to leave said videogames in a functional (playable) state.
               

                Specifically, the initiative seeks to prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.
               

                The initiative does not seek to acquire ownership of said videogames, associated intellectual rights or monetization rights, neither does it expect the publisher to provide resources for the said videogame once they discontinue it while leaving it in a reasonably functional (playable) state.","Videogames have grown into an industry with billions of customers worth hundreds of billions of euros. During this time, a specific business practice in the industry has been slowly emerging that is not only an assault on basic consumer rights but is destroying the medium itself. An increasing number of publishers are selling videogames that are required to connect through the internet to the game publisher, or ""phone home"" to function. While this is not a problem in itself, when support ends for these types of games, very often publishers simply sever the connection necessary for the game to function, proceed to destroy all working copies of the game, and implement extensive measures to prevent the customer from repairing the game in any way. This practice is effectively robbing customers of their purchases and makes restoration impossible. Besides being an affront on consumer rights, videogames themselves are unique creative works. Like film, or music, one cannot be simply substituted with another. By destroying them, it represents a creative loss for everyone involved and erases history in ways not possible in other mediums. Existing laws and consumer agencies are ill-prepared to protect customers against this practice. The ability for a company to destroy an item it has already sold to the customer long after the fact is not something that normally occurs in other industries. With license agreements required to simply run the game, many existing consumer protections are circumvented. This practice challenges the concept of ownership itself, where the customer is left with nothing after ""buying"" a game. We wish to invoke Article 17 §1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [ EUR-Lex - 12012P/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu) ] – “No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in good time for their loss.” – This practice deprives European citizens of their property by making it so that they lose access to their product an indeterminate/arbitrary amount of time after the point of sale. We wish to see this remedied, at the core of this Initiative. We also invoke Title XV of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)[ EUR-Lex - 12012E/TXT - EN - EUR-Lex (europa.eu) ] and the following TFEU Articles as our justification for and the Union’s imperative to respond to this initiative: Article 169 – Per §1, the EU has an obligation “to promote the interests of consumers and to ensure a high level of consumer protection…to protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers”. We believe this practice infringes upon or requires correction to be commensurate with the EU’s obligation. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames. Article 12 – “Consumer protection requirements shall be taken into account in defining and implementing other Union policies and activities.” Given that this practice extends across Member States and beyond the EU, the Union’s actions regarding this practice ought to keep consumer protection in mind. The actions taken in response to this initiative must supersede any end user license agreements associated with videogames. Article 114, §3 – “The Commission, in its proposals envisaged in paragraph 1 concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, will take as a base a high level of protection… Within their respective powers, the European Parliament and the Council will also seek to achieve this objective” This practice undermines the high level of consumer protection that the Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council takes as the basis of law in the Union, and their objectives of establishing and maintaining the functioning of an internal market as described in §1 of this Article, and Article 26 TFEU.",Verification,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en,19/06/2024,31/07/2024,31/07/2025,11/08/2025,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""19/06/2024""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""31/07/2024""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""31/07/2025""},{""step"":""Verification"",""date"":""11/08/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Germany"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":7},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","24,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Support provided to the ECI by various parties (economically non-quantifiable volunteer work)"",""date"":""01/08/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""0""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Private sponsor"",""date"":""01/08/2025"",""amount_in_eur"":""24,000""}]","1,448,270","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""22,541"",""threshold"":""13,395"",""percentage"":""168.28%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""32,081"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""216.69%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""14,714"",""threshold"":""11,985"",""percentage"":""122.77%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""14,650"",""threshold"":""8,460"",""percentage"":""173.17%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,241"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""52.98%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""27,398"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""185.06%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""38,944"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""394.57%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""9,683"",""threshold"":""4,935"",""percentage"":""196.21%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""59,368"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""601.50%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""173,146"",""threshold"":""55,695"",""percentage"":""310.88%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""306,399"",""threshold"":""67,680"",""percentage"":""452.72%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""21,575"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""145.73%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""27,316"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""184.51%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""36,753"",""threshold"":""9,165"",""percentage"":""401.01%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""79,824"",""threshold"":""53,580"",""percentage"":""148.98%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""8,338"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""147.84%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""15,059"",""threshold"":""7,755"",""percentage"":""194.18%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,878"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""68.04%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,198"",""threshold"":""4,230"",""percentage"":""51.96%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""93,938"",""threshold"":""20,445"",""percentage"":""459.47%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""156,463"",""threshold"":""36,660"",""percentage"":""426.79%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""33,372"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""225.41%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""41,136"",""threshold"":""23,265"",""percentage"":""176.81%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""20,405"",""threshold"":""9,870"",""percentage"":""206.74%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""7,150"",""threshold"":""5,640"",""percentage"":""126.77%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""127,456"",""threshold"":""41,595"",""percentage"":""306.42%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""73,244"",""threshold"":""14,805"",""percentage"":""494.72%""}}",24,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.292780,2025-12-15T19:12:44.294230

Factory farming and slaughterhouses also pose a constant threat to public health in the form of the spread of ever new pandemics and health and hygiene problems (salmonella, avian influenza, etc.). Closing these places down and using EU funding to incentivise the conversion of existing animal husbandry activities into activities involving plant proteins or cultivated proteins would therefore be a valuable tool to prevent new diseases. WE THEREFORE CALL FOR: 1) incentives for the production of plant proteins, including plant-based milk and egg substitutes, and for the production of cultivated meat, as well as for research into increasingly ‘clean’ and ‘ethical’ production of cultivated meat, thereby improving animal welfare and helping to protect the environment and public health; 2) plans to gradually reduce the number of farm animals at a rate of 50% of the existing number of farm animals each year – starting from the year that the requirement and the necessary directive are transposed in each Member State – and to progressively close all animal farms. This is a question of complying with the 1978 Universal Declaration of Animal Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon, and responding to the growing sensitivity to and awareness of the problematic existence of these farms and slaughterhouses and their potential as sources of ever new pandemics and health and hygiene issues (salmonella, avian influenza, etc.). This should begin with the curbing of factory farms, followed by free-range farms and slaughterhouses, these being places of animal suffering and exploitation which also carry the risk of spreading new diseases and pandemics. FURTHER INFORMATION ‘All animals are born with an equal claim on life and the same rights to existence’, according to the Universal Declaration of Animal Rights signed in Paris on 15 October 1978. Similarly, Article 13 of the Treaty of Lisbon recognises animals as ‘sentient beings’ and provides that ‘the Union and the Member States shall ... pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals’. The reality, however, is quite different. Animal exploitation is becoming increasingly common in the EU Member States. For this reason, in line with the 1978 Universal Declaration of Animal Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon, we are calling for recognition of the fact that it is an aberration to keep animals for the sole purpose of fattening and slaughtering them, and that it is an aberration to keep animals for the sole purpose of enriching those who keep them (animals being reared and slaughtered for the sale of their meat, animals being exploited and slaughtered for their wool, milk or eggs, chicks being shredded alive for the mere fact of being male, etc.). We are also calling for the progressive closure of animal farms and slaughterhouses by shifting EU subsidies from animal husbandry to ethical production. This would incentivise production of plant proteins , including plant-based milk and egg substitutes, and the production of cultivated meat to be fed mainly to pets and companion animals . There are also public health arguments for phasing out the practice of rearing animals to be fattened, exploited and killed in slaughterhouses and replacing it with ‘ethical’ and ‘clean’ alternatives. These farms are considered, including by scientific and environmental impact studies, to be genuine ‘ticking time bombs’, often due to the presence of so many sentient beings of the same species being kept in small spaces one on top of the other. The farms also increase the risk of future spillover events and the emergence and spread of future pandemics. Poultry farms in particular carry the highest risk of the emergence of influenza pandemics affecting animals and people (there have been cases of cows contracting avian influenza H5N1; one case of avian influenza has also been identified in a dairy farm worker in Michigan, USA). We would also like to recall two other problems: the phenomenon of ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE and the high risk of salmonella due to poor hygiene in animal farms and slaughterhouses. The many articles on these topics include: 1) COVID AND FACTORY FARMING.

The reference to the country of origin or place of provenance must be displayed to avoid further confusing consumers with the use of general geographical references (EU, NON-EU, or EU and NON-EU) ( Article 26(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 and Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2018/775 ).

This means that a product’s ‘origin’ as indicated on the label is usually the country where the processing establishment is located, unless there is an explicit obligation also to indicate the provenance of the agricultural product used in processing (as is the case in Italy for milk, cheese, pasta, rice, processed tomatoes and processed pork, applicable to establishments operating within Italy’s national borders). The ambiguity becomes clear when one considers the definition of ‘place of provenance’ (Article 2(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011): ‘any place where a food is indicated to come from, and that is not the “country of origin” as determined in accordance with Articles 23 to 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92’ (replaced by Article 60(2) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013). Unclear and perhaps intentionally ambiguous indications of origin provide opportunities for phenomena such as misleading geographical identity, false product identity and misrepresentation of products, and facilitate counterfeiting. It is thus necessary to establish, transparently and unambiguously, that the origin of a food product corresponds to the country of provenance of the agricultural product (where it was grown, reared or fished) and the place where it was processed , both of which (if different) must be indicated on the label or in other forms of information for consumers (menus, signs, etc.). 2) Under Articles 168, 169 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Union action, which complements national policies, includes monitoring, early warning of and combating serious cross-border threats to health. To guarantee public health and consumer protection, it is necessary to apply the principle of reciprocity in commercial relations with third countries , to make sure that all products entering the Union meet the environmental, health and labour standards that apply in the internal market, and prohibit imports of food processed using substances and methods banned in Europe . This prohibition must also be reaffirmed in the EU’s international agreements concluded under Articles 216-219 TFEU. 3) The EU is one of the largest free trade areas in the world, with a market of around half a billion users/consumers. Regular official controls on consignments of goods not subject to enhanced measures are organised on the basis of a risk assessment in accordance with Article 43 et seq., par. 3, of Regulation (EU) 2017/625. To curb food scams, which harm farmers and consumers, there is a need to increase the frequency and thoroughness of controls on food and feed imports . Such controls must be effective in preventing risks to public health, protecting consumers’ interests and ensuring fairness in commercial transactions. 4) Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 states, as a general principle of transparency, that indication of the country of origin or place of provenance is mandatory where failure to indicate this might mislead the consumer as to the true country of origin or place of provenance of the food, if the information accompanying the food or the label as a whole would otherwise imply that the food has a different country of origin or place of provenance. In practice, however, indication of origin applies only when provided for under specific sectoral rules; Article 26(3), which lays down the obligation to indicate the origin of the primary ingredient where it differs from the origin indicated for the food, has also been weakened by derogations and the excessive discretion granted to industry under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/775. Therefore, to prevent fraud, protect public health and guarantee consumers’ right to information, Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 must be amended to include an obligation to indicate the provenance of all food products, whether packaged or served in out-of-home catering establishments, i.e. in school canteens, businesses, hospitals and restaurants .",Collection closed,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000009_en,24/07/2024,21/09/2024,21/09/2025,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""24/07/2024""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""21/09/2024""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""21/09/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Italy"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":0},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","20,000.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Confederazione Nazionale Coldiretti"",""date"":""10/06/2024"",""amount_in_eur"":""20,000""}]","868,587","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""352"",""threshold"":""14,400"",""percentage"":""2.44%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""426"",""threshold"":""15,840"",""percentage"":""2.69%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""185"",""threshold"":""12,240"",""percentage"":""1.51%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""217"",""threshold"":""8,640"",""percentage"":""2.51%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""63"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""1.46%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,235"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""8.17%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""141"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""1.31%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""35"",""threshold"":""5,040"",""percentage"":""0.69%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""385"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""3.56%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,654"",""threshold"":""58,320"",""percentage"":""2.84%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,583"",""threshold"":""69,120"",""percentage"":""2.29%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""251"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""1.66%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""185"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""1.22%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""216"",""threshold"":""10,080"",""percentage"":""2.14%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""841,188"",""threshold"":""54,720"",""percentage"":""1,537.26%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""85"",""threshold"":""6,480"",""percentage"":""1.31%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""91"",""threshold"":""7,920"",""percentage"":""1.15%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""49"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""1.13%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""19"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""0.44%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""503"",""threshold"":""22,320"",""percentage"":""2.25%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""766"",""threshold"":""38,160"",""percentage"":""2.01%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""292"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""1.93%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""503"",""threshold"":""23,760"",""percentage"":""2.12%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""5,214"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""48.28%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""179"",""threshold"":""6,480"",""percentage"":""2.76%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""12,356"",""threshold"":""43,920"",""percentage"":""28.13%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""414"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""2.74%""}}",1,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.464476,2025-12-15T19:12:44.465740
2024/000010,ECI for a Water-Smart and Resilient Europe,"To advocate for a strategic and holistic action plan for water in Europe, and the development and implementation of dual, complementary policies in all EU policy areas, as called for in the Declaration for an EU Blue Deal.
                



                 To urge the European Commission to prioritise water as a strategic standalone priority within the EU framework and elevate water resilience to the same priority level as decarbonisation.
                



                 To significantly reduce the water footprint of all segments of society and stress a paradigm shift at the European level to safeguard clean water for individuals, businesses, farmers and ecosystems.
                



                 To accelerate a shift towards water-efficient, circular industry and agriculture, to secure competitiveness by promoting innovative solutions such as digital tools, resource recovery, hybrid green-grey infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and inclusive governance tools.
                



                 To ensure the availability of the right skills for a water-smart econ","Europe is increasingly experiencing the impacts of the global water crisis, grappling with droughts and floods, which compromise water quality and access to safe drinking water. Our continent faces a notable deficit in water efficiency across various sectors, including supply infrastructures, production processes, and consumption patterns, hindering the achievement of SDG 6 and risking European competitiveness due to water disruption risks. Previously taken for granted, access to water is now becoming uncertain. Around 10 million people in Europe lack access to safe drinking water, while globally, the amount of available drinking water is insufficient to meet all needs. Agriculture, the largest water user, is particularly affected by water scarcity, highlighting the urgency for a Water-Smart Society that supports our farmers and necessitates proactive measures from industries. The Global Water Report 2020 by CDP highlighted that the cost of water risks to businesses could be more than five times the cost of addressing those risks through investment. As such, the hydrogen industry, essential for Europe’s green energy transition, presents an opportunity to lead in water stewardship. Producing one kilo of hydrogen requires about nine kilos of ultrapure water, and meeting European hydrogen targets will require around 90 million cubic meters of water annually. By embracing water-smart technologies, the industry can significantly contribute to a water-smart and resilient Europe. Such a proactive approach would support environmental goals and strengthen the industry's long-term viability and public support. The challenge extends to the European water policy landscape, which is currently fragmented and ineffective in addressing these pressing issues. Despite the advanced state of EU’s water legislation compared to the rest of world, many goals remain unfulfilled due to insufficient funding, delayed implementation, and lack of comprehensive integration of water concerns into sectoral policies. This results in water considerations being inadequately reflected in decision-making processes and absent in many key policy areas. In May 2024, the European Commission launched an awareness-raising campaign, WaterWiseEU, inviting European citizens to “See Water Differently” and aiming to build a water-resilient Europe by 2050. This campaign is a welcome step but needs to translate into political ownership and concrete actions. This ECI recognises that citizens can contribute to innovative solutions to tackle water-related challenges in all dimensions: domestic, economic, and environmental. It calls for adopting a comprehensive strategic political priority on water integrated into all EU policies. A paradigm shift at EU level is critical to safeguard clean water for all and to facilitate a genuine transition towards a water-smart society. This entails a consolidated effort to enhance water governance, improve efficiency, and integrate water sustainability into all facets of policy and practice. Despite the overarching goal of reducing the continent’s carbon footprint, investments in water-intensive projects continue in regions already facing severe water scarcity. Traditionally integrated within the Green Deal, aimed at achieving a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050, water issues require a distinct focus. The Declaration for an EU Blue Deal provides this focus and proposes to establish a platform for institutional, stakeholder, and citizen engagement. Addressing water resilience necessitates a sector-specific approach. It is key to incorporate water considerations into each industry, particularly transition pathways, and propose tailored solutions rather than uniform water consumption reductions across the board. Given technological advancements, certain sectors could rapidly reduce their water footprint, while others may require more time to adjust. High-water-use industries need support in adopting more efficient technologies. Furthermore, ensuring the availability of the right skills is important. This approach will preserve jobs and create new opportunities, especially in clean technologies. Like any industrial change, the transition to water resilience will succeed only with adequate resources, both in financing and human resources. The challenge of water resilience and decarbonisation demands equal and determined effort. The EU must adopt complementary policies addressing both concerns, considering water's critical role within this context, extending beyond environmental remits. Questions such as water distribution and health exist independently of the climate issue. There is growing consensus that an EU Blue Deal could mark a crucial moment for Europe's long-term water resilience. Such an approach must be paired with raising public awareness regarding water consumption and good practices. There is strong citizen support[1] for additional EU measures to address water-related problems in Europe, and many Europeans feel that national stakeholders are not doing enough to use water efficiently. Integration of the water dimension into all EU policies is crucial to ensure water sustainability is woven into the fabric of European policies. This integration means assessing how each EU policy can impact water resources in terms of quantity, quality, and accessibility. This would ensure that water resilience and sustainability are primary considerations in policy formulation and implementation, shifting the paradigm from treating water as an infinite resource to recognising its critical role in the EU’s ecological and socio-economic landscape. Water is not only an ecological issue but intersects significantly with all socio-economic dimensions of Europe, including agriculture, industry, health, urban development, and energy production.",Collection closed,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000010_en,11/09/2024,23/10/2024,23/10/2025,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""11/09/2024""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""23/10/2024""},{""step"":""Collection closed"",""date"":""23/10/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Romania"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":7},""others"":{""number_of_people"":3},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":1}}",,,"4,442","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""177"",""threshold"":""14,400"",""percentage"":""1.23%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""217"",""threshold"":""15,840"",""percentage"":""1.37%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""50"",""threshold"":""12,240"",""percentage"":""0.41%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""64"",""threshold"":""8,640"",""percentage"":""0.74%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""20"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""0.46%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""44"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""0.29%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""43"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""0.40%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""10"",""threshold"":""5,040"",""percentage"":""0.20%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""118"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""1.09%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""663"",""threshold"":""58,320"",""percentage"":""1.14%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""769"",""threshold"":""69,120"",""percentage"":""1.11%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""84"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""0.56%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""106"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""0.70%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""68"",""threshold"":""10,080"",""percentage"":""0.67%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""745"",""threshold"":""54,720"",""percentage"":""1.36%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""13"",""threshold"":""6,480"",""percentage"":""0.20%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""19"",""threshold"":""7,920"",""percentage"":""0.24%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""48"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""1.11%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""2"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""0.05%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""175"",""threshold"":""22,320"",""percentage"":""0.78%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""260"",""threshold"":""38,160"",""percentage"":""0.68%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""106"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""0.70%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""122"",""threshold"":""23,760"",""percentage"":""0.51%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""40"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""0.37%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""43"",""threshold"":""6,480"",""percentage"":""0.66%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""316"",""threshold"":""43,920"",""percentage"":""0.72%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""120"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""0.79%""}}",0,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.547063,2025-12-15T19:12:44.548404
2024/000011,PsychedeliCare,"We call on the European Commission to foster equitable, timely, affordable, safe, and legal access to innovative psychedelic-assisted therapies.
                








                 The Commission should support the establishment of an expert consensus on standards of psychedelic care, with psychological support, therapist training, ethical guidelines and safety measures, to ensure the safe and effective rollout of psychedelic therapies. The Commission should back capacity building efforts for multidisciplinary training programs on mental health, specifically designed for psychedelic therapy training for healthcare providers.
                



                 The Commission should boost EU-funded research into the therapeutic applications of psychedelics to strengthen the evidence of their safety and efficacy. It should support the development of research networks focusing on innovative therapies.
                



                 The Commission should adopt common positions within UN fora to advocate for pragmatic, progressive transnational regulations concerning psychede","There is a mental health crisis in the EU. One in six people suffer from mental health conditions, and half felt depressed or anxious in the last 12 months as of June 2023. OECD data shows the economic costs of mental illnesses have been estimated at 4.2% of the Union’s annual GDP, equating to €600 billion a year. Up to 50% of patients do not respond to the psychiatric treatments currently available. There have been no substantial innovations in the field of mental health since the advent of SSRIs, which are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. The EU has approved only one new psychiatric treatment in the last three years, in stark contrast to the 68 approvals in oncology. This trend persists despite the escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness that have become increasingly prevalent in our population. However, a growing body of scientific evidence indicates the effectiveness of psychedelic-assisted therapies . These patient-centric personalised treatment pathways can provide safe, rapid and robust clinical improvements with durable effects in treating conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, end-of-life anxiety, and substance use disorders. In the US, the FDA has granted five “ breakthrough therapy ” designations for MDMA, psilocybin, and LSD treatments. In Canada, psychedelic-assisted therapy has been permitted since the beginning of 2022 for treating patients suffering from end-of-life anxiety, due to a life-threatening condition resistant to other treatments. Switzerland also allowed such therapies for specific cases and contributed to research. In the UK, Europe’s first commercial facility for psychedelic drug trials has opened in London, and the Centre for Psychedelic Research at the Imperial College London is focusing on the use of psychedelics in mental health care. In Australia, psychiatrists are authorised to prescribe MDMA for addressing PTSD, and psilocybin for treating treatment-resistant depression. In the European Union, scientific research is insufficient and highly dependent on Member States. At the same time, mental health has moved up the European agenda, particularly since the COVID-19 crisis. We recognise the efforts undertaken by the Commission through its actions stemming from the ""Communication on a comprehensive approach to mental health"", and hope that the flagship programmes included could address the capacity building needs for training the healthcare on the standards of care for psychedelic therapies. In the context of a global psychedelic renaissance, the Commission should build on this momentum to proactively establish the legal framework and medical conditions for integrating psychedelics into therapy in the EU. Access to innovative mental health therapies should be part of the European Commission’s priority actions on mental health. Multidisciplinary training programmes on mental health for health professionals, modelled on the EU-PROMENS project, could help train thousands of medical professionals in the best practices and standards of care for psychedelic therapies, striving towards the equal accessibility to these innovative treatments for patients in the EU. As State parties to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), all EU member states are duty-bound to respect, protect and fulfil the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health , as set out in Article 12 as well as the freedom of research and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its application , as set out in Article 15 of the same Covenant. We propose the Article 168 of the TFEU as the legal basis of this initiative, as it states that the Union action “ shall be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases ”, and it empowers the Council and the Parliament, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, to adopt “ measures setting high standards of quality and safety for medicinal products and devices for medical use .” We call on the Commission to recognise the unique specificities of psychedelic therapies and their potential to meet high unmet needs for mental health conditions and substance use disorders, which, even if not immediately life-threatening, impose a burden on individuals, healthcare systems, societies, and economies. Special regulatory frameworks or sandboxes, which allow experimenting with new regulatory approaches for novel therapies in a limited part of a sector or area, could help develop and evaluate new care standards for optimal, personalised treatment pathways, and address uncertainties in clinical settings, therapy combinations, and patient unmet needs. We urge the European Commission to foster equitable, timely, affordable, safe, and legal access to innovative psychedelic-assisted therapies. The following strategies could be implemented: Establishing research partnerships and joint actions between the EU and Member States, Offering incentives such as increased regulatory protection, market entry rewards and milestone payment reward schemes, Providing enhanced EMA support including through PRIME, Creating a European Hub for Mental Health R&D, or a European Research Network, Implementing accelerated assessments, conditional market approvals, and adaptive pathways, Ensuring a more predictable reimbursement environment.",Collection ongoing,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000011_en,11/09/2024,,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""11/09/2024""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""14/01/2025""},{""step"":""Collection ongoing"",""date"":null}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Belgium"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":5},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","45,500.00","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Private sponsor"",""date"":""22/04/2025"",""amount_in_eur"":""45,000""},{""name_of_sponsor"":""Alek Wlezien"",""date"":""20/04/2025"",""amount_in_eur"":""500""}]","45,349","{""Austria"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,087"",""threshold"":""14,400"",""percentage"":""7.55%""},""Belgium"":{""statements_of_support"":""2,017"",""threshold"":""15,840"",""percentage"":""12.73%""},""Bulgaria"":{""statements_of_support"":""166"",""threshold"":""12,240"",""percentage"":""1.36%""},""Croatia"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,079"",""threshold"":""8,640"",""percentage"":""12.49%""},""Cyprus"":{""statements_of_support"":""41"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""0.95%""},""Czechia"":{""statements_of_support"":""538"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""3.56%""},""Denmark"":{""statements_of_support"":""852"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""7.89%""},""Estonia"":{""statements_of_support"":""766"",""threshold"":""5,040"",""percentage"":""15.20%""},""Finland"":{""statements_of_support"":""816"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""7.56%""},""France"":{""statements_of_support"":""8,510"",""threshold"":""58,320"",""percentage"":""14.59%""},""Germany"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,925"",""threshold"":""69,120"",""percentage"":""5.68%""},""Greece"":{""statements_of_support"":""778"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""5.15%""},""Hungary"":{""statements_of_support"":""605"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""4.00%""},""Ireland"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,063"",""threshold"":""10,080"",""percentage"":""10.55%""},""Italy"":{""statements_of_support"":""9,308"",""threshold"":""54,720"",""percentage"":""17.01%""},""Latvia"":{""statements_of_support"":""293"",""threshold"":""6,480"",""percentage"":""4.52%""},""Lithuania"":{""statements_of_support"":""482"",""threshold"":""7,920"",""percentage"":""6.09%""},""Luxembourg"":{""statements_of_support"":""251"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""5.81%""},""Malta"":{""statements_of_support"":""132"",""threshold"":""4,320"",""percentage"":""3.06%""},""Netherlands"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,054"",""threshold"":""22,320"",""percentage"":""4.72%""},""Poland"":{""statements_of_support"":""4,122"",""threshold"":""38,160"",""percentage"":""10.80%""},""Portugal"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,194"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""7.90%""},""Romania"":{""statements_of_support"":""664"",""threshold"":""23,760"",""percentage"":""2.79%""},""Slovakia"":{""statements_of_support"":""286"",""threshold"":""10,800"",""percentage"":""2.65%""},""Slovenia"":{""statements_of_support"":""463"",""threshold"":""6,480"",""percentage"":""7.15%""},""Spain"":{""statements_of_support"":""3,795"",""threshold"":""43,920"",""percentage"":""8.64%""},""Sweden"":{""statements_of_support"":""1,062"",""threshold"":""15,120"",""percentage"":""7.02%""}}",0,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.630281,2025-12-15T19:12:44.631589

Instead, we will have built billions of square meters of new space as a replacement for what was already there. ​This practice creates social, economic, environmental, and cultural problems as demolition comes with a loss of homes, jobs, energy, and history. The Speculation Issue The current system is designed to demolish and build anew, driven by regulations and incentives that favor new construction. Existing buildings are replaced with high-end developments, putting profit over people. However, the relation between speculation and redevelopment, with the needs of communities and ecosystems, is complex. While development is essential for our society, it's equally crucial to ensure that it doesn't come at the expense of existing communities, local economies, our planetary ecosystem, and history. Thus, our aim is to shed light on the harmful practices of speculative real estate development that are the reason for demolition and that impact each and every one of us. The Construction Crisis The building industry’s impact on our lives is significant, and it is therefore urgent that it becomes part of our daily conversations. It stands as one of the most profitable and vital markets within the EU, yet it is also one of the most significant contributors to CO2 emissions and energy consumption. According to the European Commission, buildings are responsible for approximately 36% of CO2 emissions and 40% of total energy consumption in the EU, representing 35% of energy-related EU emissions in 2021. Moreover, the sector generates over 35% of the EU's total waste, highlighting its substantial environmental footprint. Yet, we maintain a system in which buying something new is cheaper than caring for the old. This system prioritizes financial profit over the well-being of the people and the planet. A system in which renovation and adaptation have taken a backseat to demolition and new construction. This may have worked in the past, when resources seemed in endless supply and new construction was cheaper, faster, and easier than dealing with existing buildings. But current material and energy shortages show us that this system no longer works. Therefore, the building sector is pivotal in the social and ecological transformation, and all the parties involved – from the real estate sector to architects to the construction industry – must recognize the risks of demolition and the potential of renovation. The Renovation Market The renovation of public and private buildings presents enormous potential. The goal of EU member states to renovate our existing buildings by 2050 can be translated into tangible numbers: Currently, only 25% of the European building stock has been renovated, meaning that 75% of the work is still ahead of us. At the current annual renovation rate of 1%, it would take three times longer than we have to reach the agreed goals. Therefore, we face a reality: we need to triple the renovation rate to reach our goals! To do so, we must recognize the value of existing buildings and prioritize their renovation. Renovation is a great answer to ensure affordable living spaces, support small and medium-scale businesses, reduce CO2 emissions, and preserve memories and communities. So, how do we achieve a shift and make a change in reality? The EU has the power to change this by implementing the objectives of HouseEurope! ➔ Preserving Existing Structures: Advocate for the preservation, renovation, and adaptive reuse of buildings to conserve resources, reduce CO₂ emissions, and maintain cultural and historical continuity. ➔ Implementing Economic Incentives: Propose measures like tax incentives and harmonization of standards to make renovation more attractive and economically viable than demolition. ➔ Valuing Embodied Energy: Highlight the importance of accounting for the energy already invested in buildings to shift past environmental impacts toward future sustainability. ➔ Creating Affordable Housing: Leverage the cost advantages of existing buildings to create affordable living spaces, mitigate gentrification, and prevent displacement of communities. ➔ Transforming the Construction Sector: Aim to shift the industry from material-intensive to labor-intensive, creating jobs and boosting local businesses across Europe. ➔ Aligning with EU Policies: Build on existing national and EU legislation to promote renovation and transformation and enhance sustainability – socially, economically, and ecologically. ➔ Reaching Climate Goals: Encourage renovation and transformation of existing buildings, contributing to the EU’s goal of decarbonizing the building stock by 2050.",Collection

2025/000002,"Food is a Human Right for All! Guaranteeing healthy, just and sustainable food systems","At least one fifth of the European population has no access to adequate food. Industrial food systems aggravate food insecurity, climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, labour exploitation and animal suffering. The EU must guarantee the right to food systemically and promote healthy, just, humane and sustainable food systems for present and future generations. Achieving these goals requires proposing or amending EU legal acts in these areas:
               

                • Fair food systems and democratic governance
               

                • Support to national social protection initiatives • Recognizing that agricultural products and foodstuff are not ordinary commodities
               

                • Support to peasant agroecology and territorial food systems
               

                • Combating agricultural land’s concentration
               

                • Support to peasant seed systems
               

                • Strict regulation of GMOs, including those obtained with new genomic techniques
               

                • Sustainab","We call on the European Commission (EC) to make the right to food a reality. The right to food is recognized in international treaties ratified by all EU countries. It is guaranteed when everyone has dignified access to adequate food on a sustainable basis. It is realised systematically through ensuring access to productive resources, a decent wage or income, and social policies. We urge the EC to: 1. Promote a regulation on sustainable and fair food systems built on the right to food. 2. Create an EU Food Council to coordinate action, prioritizing the voices of the least represented, and considering inequality in access to resources and market power. 3. Propose a directive aimed at supporting national social protection initiatives, in particular regarding social security for food, cooperation between Member States, and the adoption of common indicators of food insecurity and right to food implementation. 4. Recognize that agricultural products and foodstuff are not ordinary commodities by proposing regulations aimed at (i) protecting decent income for peasants and other small-scale food producers and decent wages for workers in the food chains, (ii) enabling access to healthy, sustainable and affordable food for all, including through VAT reductions, (iii) reducing market power of big companies at all stages of the food chains, and (iv) promoting local and regional food markets. Propose a modification of MiFiD II to ban any form of speculation in agricultural commodities and foodstuff. 5. In the future Common Agricultural Policy, considerably increase support to small-scale producers, territorial food systems, decent work, organic farming and peasant agroecology. Relaunch a regulation to further reduce the use of synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and antimicrobials for farm animals and aquaculture. 6. Propose a directive to reduce the concentration of agricultural land, both in the EU and abroad, and to facilitate generational renewal and gender equality in access to land. 7. Propose a regulation to support the autonomy of peasant seed systems, agrobiodiversity and seeds that are suitable for organic production or production with low synthetic chemical inputs. 8. Withdraw the proposal to deregulate new genomic techniques (NGTs) or, in the alternate, ensure on the basis of a regulation a comparable level of protection when introducing GMOs obtained with NGTs as under legislation currently in force, particularly including a requirement of authorisation for all kinds of NGTs, traceability and labelling, and a patent ban on classical breeding and on GMOs obtained with NGTs in the absence of publication of the processes enabling them to be distinguished from any other organism. Support independent scientific knowledge to implement the principles of traceability, risk analysis and precaution, including for old and new NGTs. 9. Propose a directive for sustainable water management in agricultural production and sustainable fisheries. 10. Propose a regulation that strengthens animal welfare standards, including the demands of the End the Cage Age ECI, and introduces concrete measures to reduce the production and consumption of industrial animal products, while providing adequate support for farmers in the transition. 11. Propose a directive aimed at promoting healthy and sustainable diets, supporting greater consumption of fruits and vegetables and regulating the consumption of and marketing for ultraprocessed food and beverages to reduce related non-communicable diseases and obesity. 12. Propose a regulation on sustainable food procurement, requiring that Member States guarantee that all children in public schools have access to healthy, nutritious, sustainable and affordable school meals, including via free meals, and giving authorities greater autonomy to develop local food systems. 13. Propose a regulation to reform and harmonize food labelling in order to increase consumer information on nutritional quality, geographical origin, production methods, social standards and potentially harmful substances. Furthermore, the regulation should regulate the advertising of products whose consumption is to be restricted, in particular for children. 14. Recognize the structural nature of food loss and waste, and adopt to this effect a directive containing appropriate regulatory and policy measures and mandatory targets for reduction in the whole food chains. 15. Amend the Commission’s relevant Omnibus proposals or, in the alternate, the CSDD directive to protect the right to food and to maintain the due diligence obligations along the whole food chains. 16. In view of the EU’s international activities and policy coherence for development, we invite the Commission to submit proposals aimed at the adoption of legals acts in the following areas: (i) Authorisations to open the necessary negotiations to subordinate all existing and future trade agreements to the need to protect the right to food; (ii) A regulation prohibiting the export or import of agricultural products at prices that have a negative impact on peasant agriculture; and (iii) A regulation prohibiting the export in third countries of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers banned in Europe.",Collection start date,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2025/000002_en,08/07/2025,07/01/2026,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""08/07/2025""},{""step"":""Collection start date"",""date"":""07/01/2026""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Greece"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":5},""others"":{""number_of_people"":1},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}","51,076.32","[{""name_of_sponsor"":""Fondation Salvia"",""date"":""23/07/2025"",""amount_in_eur"":""51,076.32""}]",,,,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:44.820565,2025-12-15T19:12:44.821734
2025/000003,"Save your right, save your flight!","The Council is trying to push through devastating changes to passenger rights that will water down protections travellers have relied on for two decades.
               

                What We're Losing:
               

                Time – Under the current proposal, compensation will only be granted after delays of at least 4 hours up from at least 2 hours.
               

                Money – Compensations are being slashed by €100 for medium and long-haul flights, despite the rising delays and travel costs.
               

                Rights – Protections under current law are being reduced. Rolling back existing rights sets a dangerous precedent.
               

                The Reality:
               

                Most flight delays are under 4 hours, meaning that passengers will now lose their right to compensation. Those who qualify will receive less money. Airlines lobbied hard for these changes, but travellers will pay the price through worse service and less recourse.

                ”, the same on every member state passport cover, alongside any required references in the respective national language. This design would coexist with the current burgundy passport cover, which continues to be available when renewing or obtaining a new passport.
               

                Passports issued by EU Member States are primarily used for travel outside the European Union in countries where a","Motivation European Citizens today carry passports with covers that display only a subtle reference to the European Union—very weak as it is not written many times in a quick and internationally recognisable form (e.g. Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση, Evropská unie, Euroopa Liit, Европейски съюз, etc). At a time when European unity is both more important and more questioned than ever, citizens deserve the choice to display their European identity alongside their national one. Passports are more than travel documents—they are symbols of who we are. The passport cover is the strongest symbol of a person’s identity. Since the 1980s, EU countries have harmonised their passport designs around a burgundy cover, reflecting a shared European standard but still centred on national identity. Offering an alternative passport cover with an EU-blue background and gold stars would give EU Citizens a simple, elegant and strong way to express their belonging to the European Union when travelling around the world. It also promotes a sense of solidarity and shared values. Moreover, with global mobility increasing and European Citizens frequently travelling outside the EU, a recognisable EU design could reinforce the visibility and standing of the European Union internationally. At the same time, by providing this option, Member States would demonstrate their commitment to the expression by their citizens of their European identity. It would allow individuals who wish to visibly affirm their belonging to the Union to do so, reinforcing the sense of common membership and a shared identity. Objectives 1. Primary Objective: To ensure that the scope of this initiative is formally put forward as a proposal by the European Commission to the Council of the European Union, for debate and, subject to agreement, adopted either as a Council Regulation or as an EU Council Resolution. This would establish a common framework enabling Member States to offer an additional option for the cover design of passports issued to their citizens. 2. Secondary Objective: Beyond the formal scope of placing this matter on the agenda, the initiative seeks to achieve the actual adoption by the EU Council of an instrument—whether a Regulation or a Resolution—that invites or requires Member States to provide citizens with the option of selecting an alternative passport cover design reflecting the requests of this EU Citizens' Initiative. 3. Tertiary Objective: To ensure, following adoption at the EU level, the effective ratification, implementation or incorporation of the agreed instrument by the Member States in accordance with their procedures, thereby making the alternative passport cover option available in practice to all EU citizens. The secondary and tertiary objectives are beyond the scope of the group of organisers as a whole. Background of the Initiative This initiative arises in the context of ongoing reflections on the appropriate balance between European and Member State identities as expressed through the passport. The organisers fully acknowledge that many citizens wish primarily to emphasise their Member State identity, and that current passport cover formats should continue to reflect this. At the same time, they recognise that a significant number of citizens also wish to give visible expression to their European identity when travelling. The initiative does not seek to eliminate the current burgundy passport covers, but rather to provide an additional, voluntary option. In this light, the organisers have made use of the European Citizens’ Initiative mechanism established under Regulation (EU) 2019/788, which allows EU citizens to invite the European Commission to facilitate the introduction of such an option. How the current passport cover was established Harmonisation began via Council Resolutions (1981–1986, 1995) establishing a uniform format: burgundy covers, EU designation, state emblem, “Passport.” A 17 Oct 2000 Resolution updated non-binding minimum security standards (biometrics, anti-fraud) but kept the burgundy format. Finally, Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004 introduced binding EU law on security features and biometrics, but left colour/design guidance unchanged and voluntary. What the European Commission could do: - Propose/coordinate a new Council Resolution: The Commission has exclusive legislative initiative on borders, visas, and passport format cooperation (Art. 77(3) TFEU).

2025/000005,Demand the full suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement in view of Israel’s violations of human rights,"According to the European Commission, the State of Israel is responsible for an unprecedented level of killing and injury of civilians, a large-scale displacement of population and the systematic destruction of hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza. [1] Israel also implemented a blockade of humanitarian aid that could amount to starvation as a method of war. Israel is in breach of multiple rules and obligations under international law and fails to prevent the crime of genocide as ordered by the International Court of Justice.[2]
               

                Yet the European Union has still not suspended its association agreement with Israel, which is the cornerstone of EU-Israel bilateral trade, economic, and political cooperation.
               

                EU citizens cannot tolerate that the EU maintains an agreement that contributes to legitimize and finance a State that commits crimes against humanity and war crimes.
               

                Therefore, we call on the Commission to put forward the proposal to the Council for the full suspension of the EU-Isra","In 1995, the EU has concluded an Association agreement with the State of Israel, aiming at facilitating and increasing trade, providing a framework for bilateral political dialogue, and fostering scientific, technologic and cultural cooperation. With more than 34% of Israel's imports originating from the EU, and 28.8% of Israeli exports flowing to the EU, the EU is Israel’s first trade partner. Total trade in goods between the EU and Israel in 2024 amounted to €42.6 billion.[3] In 2021, Israel joined Horizon Europe, the EU’s main funding programme for research and innovation.1.11 billion euros from the EU’s Horizon Europe fund goes to Israeli companies, universities and public bodies. Among the 921 projects with 231 Israeli recipients are companies that are closely involved with the Israeli military.[4] Article 2 of the EU-Israel association agreement provides that “Relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement” A breach of Article 2 gives the right to the other Party to unilaterally suspend the Agreement. Several international institutions have given evidence that Israel is in breach of Article 2 : The European External Action Service (EEAS) report, [5] communicated to the Council on 20 June 2025 gives a detailed account of the rules and obligations of international law breached by the State of Israel in the Gaza Strip and in the West bank; particularly with regard to the blockade of humanitarian aid, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, the systematic targeting of hospitals and medical facilities, and forced displacement of populations. In its Order of 26 January 2024,[6] the International Court of Justice (ICJ) orders the State of Israel to do all in its power to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. ICJ Order of 28 March2024 [7] orders the State of Israel to “Take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay, in full co-operation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care to Palestinians throughout Gaza [...]. By the ICJ Order of May 2024 [8] “The Court considers that, in conformity with its obligations under the Genocide Convention, Israel must immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”. ICJ Advisory Opinion of 22 October 2025 provides that Israel must “ensure that the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory has the essential supplies of daily life, including food, water, clothing, bedding, shelter, fuel, medical supplies and services” and “facilitate by all means at its disposal relief schemes on behalf of the population of the Occupied Palestinian Territory so long as that population is inadequately supplied, as has been the case in the Gaza Strip”.[9] Despite the evidence of multiple violations of human rights and international law brought up by the abovementioned institutions, the European Union has still to this date not taken any meaningful action to condemn or to sanction the State of Israel, like, for instance, the suspension of its association agreement with Israel. Such failure to act is not in line with the EU Treaties themselves : it is clear from the Treaties that all actions and policies of the EU, including international agreements, must contribute to and ensure respect of human rights and international law. According to Article 3 (5) of the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), “In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall uphold and promote its values” [...] and “shall contribute to peace, security, the sustainable development of the Earth, solidarity and mutual respect among peoples [....] and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child, as well as to the strict observance and the development of international law, including respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter.” In addition, article 21 TEU states that “The Union's action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.” Article 205 TFEU states that “The Union's action on the international scene, pursuant to this Part, shall be guided by the principles, pursue the objectives and be conducted in accordance with” the provisions laid down in article 21 TEU mentioned above. Lastly, article 207 TFEU provides that “The common commercial policy shall be conducted in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union's external action” The EU’s obligation to act does not stem only from its founding treaties but also from UN treaties and customary international law and the International Court of Justice Orders. The EU must immediately utilise all available legal, diplomatic and economic means - among which the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement - to force the Israeli government to cease its human rights violations, uphold international law and to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians.

2025/000006,No more double standards on human rights,"As EU citizens we want to live in a Union that truly embodies the values we defend and believe in. Across the world, countless lives are affected by human rights violations, and we expect our Union to uphold human rights firmly and fairly, everywhere and for everyone. But what if there is differential treatment of human rights violations?
               

                In practice, the EU’s current approach to human rights suffers from double standards: it is incoherent, fragmented, and inconsistently applied across partner countries. As the EU acts differently depending on the country, this leads to uneven responses that weaken the universal nature of human rights.
               

                This initiative calls on the European Commission to propose a regulation that establishes a standardised oversight of human rights across its areas of competence in its external action with third countries. The regulation should ensure that the Commission monitors, evaluates, and responds to human rights violations in a manner that is transparent, consistent, effective, proportionate and","Further details on the proposal The European Union (EU) is committed to promote human rights both within its borders and abroad. This commitment has led to the inclusion of human rights conditionalities into trade, cooperation and development agreements with other countries. As guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission has an oversight role in ensuring the uniform application of human rights in EU policy. However, the EU’s current approach to overseeing compliance with these provisions is incoherent, fragmented, and inconsistently applied across partner countries. Without a stronger legal framework, the EU risks credibility loss due to double standards on human rights, falling short of its Treaty obligations, and weakening its global leadership. Therefore, this initiative calls on the European Commission to propose a regulation establishing a framework to ensure the consistent and standardised oversight of human rights across all EU international agreements within its competences in trade, development, and cooperation for better supporting its external action. This Regulation should among others: Establish a binding human rights oversight and response mechanism. First, this will involve creating a typology of human rights situations based on clear and standardised indicators. Second, the mechanism should outline effective, proportionate and graduated responses to each identified human rights situation and contain triggers for Commission action with deadlines. Commission action can include making legislative proposals, such as to suspend (parts of) cooperation agreements or to make EU common commercial policy consistent with human rights, adjusting budget allocations, drawing-up recommendations and initiating other procedures in line with its competences. Create a regular EU oversight procedure that assesses partner countries’ compliance with human rights based on independent and transparent monitoring standards. Set up an independent monitoring instrument (e.g. a human rights observatory or expert panel), tasked with assessing partner countries’ compliance using standardised indicators and transparent methodologies. This body would publicly report its findings and issue recommendations to the Commission and European Parliament. Launch a publicly accessible complaint platform for alleged non-compliance with the response mechanism in which civil society and affected stakeholders can also raise concerns about human rights violations, with structured procedures and reasonable response timelines to support transparency and accountability. Initiate a permanent coordination mechanism within the European Commission to integrate human rights assessments, facilitate data sharing, and ensure coordinated oversight across all relevant departments and services, strengthening policy coherence in EU external actions. Context and legal basis The EU’s legal duties under Articles 2, 3(5), and 21 TEU, and Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; The EU’s obligation under Article 21 TEU to ensure coherence and treat all human rights as universal, indivisible, and equally important. Under Article 3(1) TFEU, the EU has exclusive competence over common commercial policy. Article 207 TFEU empowers the Commission to negotiate, implement, and enforce trade agreements, ensuring these agreements are compatible with internal Union policies and rules. Human rights are a core component of the Union policies, as reflected in Article 21(1) of the TEU. Articles 208 and 212 TFEU govern development and economic cooperation; Article 208 TFEU governs development cooperation and requires that EU policies in this area complement Member State action. It mandates that the Union’s development cooperation policy shall be conducted within the framework of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action, including respect for human rights under Article 21 TEU. Article 212 TFEU governs economic, financial, and technical cooperation with third countries not qualifying as developing countries. Articles 180(1) and 186 TFEU support international cooperation in research and innovation Article 218 TFEU sets procedures for concluding international agreements. Article 21 TEU requires the Union’s external action to be guided by the principles of democracy, rule of law, and respect for human rights Article 6 TEU gives the Charter of Fundamental Rights the same legal value as the Treaties and Article 51 makes it binding on EU institutions when implementing EU law, including external action. Article 208 TFEU governs development cooperation and requires that EU policies in this area complement Member State action while also contributing to the overarching objective of poverty eradication. However, it also mandates that the Union’s development cooperation policy shall be conducted within the framework of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action, including respect for human rights under Article 21 TEU. Article 212 TFEU governs economic, financial, and technical cooperation with third countries not qualifying as developing countries. Article 317 TFEU and article 17 TEU gives the Commission the competence for budget execution and programme management within its areas of action. Article 14 TEU and Article 310(1) TFEU) gives the Parliament a say in the allocation of external financing instruments. Together, these empower the Commission to ensure human rights are effectively enforced across trade, development, cooperation, and funding agreements under EU competence.",Registered,https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2025/000006_en,03/12/2025,,,,,,"[{""step"":""Registered"",""date"":""03/12/2025""}]","{""number_of_people"":1,""countries_of_residence"":{""Netherlands"":1}}","{""name"":null,""country_of_residence"":null}","{""substitute"":{""number_of_people"":1},""members"":{""number_of_people"":6},""others"":{""number_of_people"":3},""dpo"":{""number_of_people"":0}}",,,,,,,,"bg,cs,da,de,el,en,es,et,fi,fr,ga,hr,hu,it,lt,lv,mt,nl,pl,pt,ro,sk,sl,sv",2025-12-15T19:12:45.145462,2025-12-15T19:12:45.146564
