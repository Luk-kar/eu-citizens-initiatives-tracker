Main conclusions of the Communication:
While the Commission does share the conviction that animal testing should be phased out in Europe, its approach for achieving that objective differs from the one proposed in this Citizens' Initiative.
The Commission considers that the Directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (Directive 2010/63/EU), which the Initiative seeks to repeal, is the right legislation to achieve the underlying objectives of the Initiative. It sets full replacement of animals as its ultimate goal as soon as it is scientifically possibly, and provides a legally binding stepwise approach as non-animal alternatives become available. Therefore, no repeal of that legislation was proposed.
Moreover, the Communication sets out four further Commission’s actions to be taken towards the goal of phasing out animal testing. These actions included a scientific conference engaging the scientific community and relevant stakeholders in a debate on how to exploit the advances in science for the development of scientifically valid non-animal approaches.
The Commission commits to active monitoring of compliance and enforcement of the legislation, and will continue supporting the development and validation of alternative approaches to the use of animals in research and testing. Dialogue with all stakeholders will continue, especially with the scientific community, to advance towards the goal of phasing out animal testing through knowledge sharing, dissemination, and education and training activities on non-animal alternatives and the Three Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal use in testing).",Rejected - Alternative Actions,,False,,True,"While the Commission does share the conviction that animal testing should be phased out in Europe, its approach for achieving that objective differs from the one proposed in this Citizens' Initiative.

Main conclusions of the Communication:
On the first aim, to 'ban glyphosate-based herbicides', the Commission concluded that there are neither scientific nor legal grounds to justify a ban of glyphosate, and will not make a legislative proposal to that effect.
On the second aim, to “ensure that the scientific evaluation of pesticides for EU regulatory approval is based only on published studies, which are commissioned by competent public authorities instead of the pesticide industry”, the Commission committed to come forward with a legislative proposal by May 2018, amongst others, to strengthen the transparency of the EU risk assessment in the food chain and enhance – through a series of measures – the governance for the conduct of industry studies submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for risk assessment. See details below under ‘Follow-up’.
On the third aim, to 'set EU-wide mandatory reduction targets for pesticide use, with a view to achieving a pesticide-free future', the Commission concluded that it intends to focus on the implementation of the [Sustainable Use Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/sustainable_use_pesticides_en) Sustainable Use Directive , and will re-evaluate the situation, initially in a report to Council and the Parliament on the implementation of the Directive to be produced in 2019.

Main conclusions of the [Communication](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=C(2021)4747&lang=en) Communication :
In its response to the ECI, the Commission communicated its intention to table a legislative proposal, by the end of 2023, to phase out, and finally prohibit, the use of cages for all animals mentioned in the ECI, under conditions to be determined on the basis of opinions from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the results of an impact assessment and a public consultation.
In parallel to the legislation and to facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, the Commission will seek specific supporting measures in key related policy areas, such as trade and research and innovation. In particular, the new Common Agricultural Policy will provide financial support and incentives – such as the new eco-schemes instrument – to help farmers upgrade to more animal-friendly facilities in line with the new standards.

**Current Followup:**
On 30 June 2021, the Commission decided to positively respond to the ECI. [In its communication](https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=C(2021)4747&lang=en) the Commission sets out plans for a legislative proposal to prohibit cages for the species and categories of animals covered by the ECI and to consider options for introducing rules or standards for imported products that are equivalent to the EU’s and/or a labelling requirement, in compliance with WTO rules. The Commission will also pursue or implement specific supporting measures in key related policy areas. The Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to complement the existing scientific evidence to determine the conditions needed for the prohibition of the use of cages. Scientific opinions were adopted by EFSA on the welfare on farm [of pigs](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2022.7421) (2022), [broilers,](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7788) addressing also broiler breeders (2022), [laying hens](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7789) , addressing also layer breeders and pullets (2022), [ducks, geese and quail](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7992) (2023) and of [calves](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.7896) (2023). The Commission also has started a series of stakeholder consultations in 2022, including in the context of subgroups of the EU Animal Welfare Platform (on poultry, on ruminants and on pigs). To facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, in which the competitiveness of the sectors concerned is further improved, the Commission is pursuing supporting measures in key related policy areas, such as research and innovation. Several research projects such as the [“Sustainability aspects of AW-promoting livestock systems”](https://www.eupahw.eu/pdf/projects/priority-%20area-3-green/JIPs_SOA17.pdf) under [the European Partnership on Animal Health and Welfare](https://www.eupahw.eu/) , may be relevant in this context. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) provides financial support and incentives – such as the new eco-schemes instrument – to help farmers upgrade to more animal-friendly facilities. In its recommendations for the National Strategic Plans under the CAP, the Commission has regularly recommended the Member States to make efforts to promote e.g. the production of eggs under non-cage systems for laying hens.",Law Promised,,True,"**Original Response:**

Consequently, no new legislation will be proposed in response to this ECI. However, the Commission will continue to ensure non-discriminatory access to Union funding and to monitor as well as support Member States' actions to guarantee equal treatment in the implementation of Cohesion policy.

Since 2019 when the initiative started its collection of support, the Commission has been engaged in intensive work under the [European Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en) European Green Deal to ensure the sustainability of food systems, including on

The [proposal for a Nature Restoration Law](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2022:304:FIN) proposal for a Nature Restoration Law tabled in June 2022 combines an overarching restoration objective for the long-term recovery of nature in the EU’s land and sea areas with binding restoration targets for specific habitats and species.
In its reply, the Commission underlined that rather than proposing new legislative acts, the priority is to ensure thatthe proposals currently being negotiated by the co-legislators are timely adopted and then implemented, together with aneffective implementation of the CAP. Over one million statements in support of this citizens’ initiative are a clear signal and encouragement that the high level of ambition of the Commission proposals should be maintained.

The Commission commits to:
● Start without delay preparatory work with a view to launch, by the end of 2023, an impact assessment on the environmental, social and economic consequences of applying the “fins naturally attached” policy to the placing on the EU market of sharks, whether within the EU or for international trade (imports and exports).
● By end 2024, provide more detailed EU’s import and export information to improve statistics on trade in shark products.
● Better enforce the EU’s already strong traceability measures by strengthening the enforcement of EU law that applies to the entire value chain - control of fishing at sea, full traceability of shark products from landing to consumer, consumer information, and prevention and redress of illegal trade - and ensuring the collection and reporting of complete and reliable information by fishermen and Member States’ authorities on all these aspects.
● Step up the EU’s international action: advocate for a worldwide ban of shark finning and strengthen the effective implementation of conservation and management measures for sharks’ species; encourage the reduction of demand for shark fins; and fight against shark fins trafficking.

The Commission outlines the following actions to further reduce animal testing in response to specific objectives of the European citizens' initiative:
Protect and strengthen the cosmetics animal testing ban:The EU Cosmetics Regulation already prohibits the placing on the market of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals, but this ban does not extend to safety tests required to assess risks from chemicals to workers and the environment under the EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). The interface between the two pieces of legislation is currently being assessed in two casesbefore the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Commission will consider the outcome of the court cases in view ofany future potential legislative changes.Transform EU chemicals legislation:The Commission will work together with all relevant parties on a roadmap towards chemical safety assessments that are free from animal testing. The roadmap will serve as a guiding framework for future actions and initiatives aimed at reducing and ultimately eliminating animal testing in the context of chemicals legislation within the European Union.Modernise science in the EU:The Commission will continue to strongly support  the development of alternative approaches with appropriate funding.

                Initiate legislative change to achieve consumer, worker, and environmental protection for all cosmetics ingredients without testing on animals for any purpose at any time.
               



                2. Transform EU chemicals regulat","The World-Leading EU Cosmetics Animal Testing and Marketing Bans We call on the European Commission to protect and strengthen the cosmetics animal testing ban. The wishes of citizens and legislators are clear: animals must not suffer and die for the sake of cosmetics. We maintain that new safety assessments for cosmetics ingredients imported into, manufactured in, or sold within the EU may only rely on non-animal data. As such, EU test requirements – including requirements set out in REACH – must not undermine the bans. Instead, a substance-tailored approach should be applied to ensure consumers, workers, and the environment are protected without further tests on animals. It is essential that the European Commission ensure proper implementation of the bans on animal testing for cosmetics and on marketing animal-tested products as originally intended and instigate legislative change to achieve this goal for both human health and environmental toxicity endpoints across all relevant sectors. To achieve the objective of protecting and strengthening the cosmetics animal testing ban, we urge the European Commission to ensure that the following mandates are met: • Immediately implement the existing EU bans on animal testing for cosmetics and the marketing of ingredients tested on animals as intended by legislators to ensure that only non-animal methods are used for the safety assessment of cosmetics ingredients. • Clarify that the requirement to rely on non-animal data for the safety assessment of cosmetics ingredients must be applied and animal data rejected, regardless of the location and purpose of animal tests conducted after the cut-off periods described in Article 18(2) of the EU Cosmetics Regulation. • Initiate legislation to strengthen and broaden the cosmetics testing bans to ensure that consumers, workers, and the environment are protected without new tests on animals. • Devise a robust testing strategy for cosmetics ingredients using only available non-animal assessment strategies so that the implementation of the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability reflects the overwhelming support for strengthening – rather than weakening – the protection of animals in Europe. Transforming Chemicals Regulation We call on the European Commission to transform EU chemicals regulation. The European Green Deal introduces a worthy commitment to a toxic-free environment whilst also presenting a golden opportunity for modern and sustainable regulation of chemicals. With the right investment and careful design, the EU could use non-animal approaches to provide the best protection of human health and the environment without wasting resources on an over-burdened and unreliable system dependent on the suffering and death of animals. To achieve the objective of ensuring sustainable chemicals regulation with recourse to additional animal test requirements, we urge the Commission to ensure that, at a minimum, the following mandates are met: • Put in place concrete steps – with dedicated funding, ambitious timelines and cross-sectoral support – to develop, validate, and implement human-relevant, non-animal approaches to identifying toxic chemicals. • Ensure that the rapid uptake of non-animal New Approach Methodologies is aligned between the European agencies with administrative responsibility for chemicals, biocides, plant protection products, pharmaceuticals, and other products. • Ensure that test requirement deadlines are not applied at the expense of scientific rigour or human and environmental safety by allowing a default fallback to reliance on unreliable tests on animals. Modernising Science in the EU We call on the European Commission to modernise science in the EU. The EU is at a crossroads. Decision-makers can choose either to continue relying on archaic animal tests or to lead the world by fostering a new era of animal-free science. Seventy-two per cent of adults in EU member states agree  that the time is right for the EU to plot a roadmap – containing concrete, measurable targets with associated timelines – towards its final goal of ending animal tests. To achieve the objective of working towards a roadmap for the phase-out of all animal testing in the EU, we urge the Commission to ensure that, at a minimum, the following mandates are met: • Openly endorse the desirability of phasing out the use of animals in science and state the belief that this is achievable. To illustrate this commitment, prioritise a transition to non-animal approaches as an integral part of all EU research, innovation, and education initiatives, while also acknowledging that Directive 2010/63/EU does not in and of itself represent a roadmap towards full replacement. • Prioritise the development and validation of non-animal methods in the EU budget and new overarching policies such as the European Green Deal, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, and post-COVID recovery plans and redirect funding away from animal studies to alternatives. • Coordinate actions across the directorates-general and agencies responsible for aspects of research, regulatory testing, education, and funding with the involvement of all member states to achieve a strategic focus on the final goal of fully replacing the use of animals in scientific procedures. • Include in the legislative proposal ambitious and achievable science-based targets with regard to a reduction in numbers of animals used, investments in advanced non-animal models and infrastructures, education and training synergy, and regulatory acceptance of non-animal methods.",Answered

The Commission has tasked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide a scientific opinion on the welfare of animals farmed for fur.
Building further on this scientific input, and on an assessment of economic and social impacts, the Commission will then communicate, by March 2026, on the most appropriate action. The Commission will also continue its preparatory work on other animal welfare proposals, as announced in the Farm to Fork Strategy.
The Commission has also proposed accompanying actions in the field of 'One Health' preventive mechanisms, invasive alien species and labelling of fur in apparel and clothing accessories.

**Current Followup:**
The Commission published the response to this initiative on 7 December 2023 in the form of [a Communication](https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2022/000002_en) , setting out the Commission's legal and political conclusions on the initiative and the actions it intended to take as a response. The Commission's actions will concern: The welfare of animals kept for fur production; The [One health dimension;](https://health.ec.europa.eu/one-health_en) the environmental aspects linked to Invasive alien species; and labelling aspects related to the animals kept for fur production. The European Commission also mandated the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to give an independent view on the protection of animals kept for fur production. [The mandate](https://open.efsa.europa.eu/questions/EFSA-Q-2023-00869) requested EFSA to deliver, one technical report, in accordance with Article 31 of [Regulation (EC) No 178/2002](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2002/178/oj) and a scientific opinion in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 for mink, foxes, raccoon dogs and chinchillas.

               It is impossible to improve the welfare of animals on fur farms. Whilst no animals should live in a caged environment, the keeping of inherently wild species in cages can only be defined as abject cruelty.
               

               The keeping and killing of animals solely for the purpose of fur production is ethically unacceptable.
               

               Numerous outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms have evidenced the veterinary-public health risks associated with the production of fur.
               

               The existence of production bans in some Member States has a distorting impact on the market for the supply of farmed fur products. This favours traders in those Member States where there is no production ban, to the detriment of those EU countries where outright bans are already in place.
               

               The placing of fur products on the internal markets of several territories and jurisdictions has already been prohibited. This inc","The need for an EU-wide ban on fur farming This European Citizens’ Initiative aims to achieve an EU-wide ban on: - keeping and killing of animals for the sole or main purpose of fur production. - placing farmed animal fur, and products containing such fur, on the EU market. Reasons why European citizens want an end on fur farming: 1) Fur farming contravenes even the most basic concept of animal welfare. Behavioural needs of animals farmed for fur cannot be met in fur farms. Neither the five freedoms, nor the five domains, can be met whilst undertaking this activity. 2) The vast majority of animals kept for fur production are still essentially wild animals. They are unsuitable to be intensively kept in caged confinement. When it comes to other animal species, like rabbits and chinchillas, the purpose of keeping animals in small cages and killing them solely or mainly because of the value of their fur cannot be legitimised either. 3) The Commission has announced its intention to phase out caged confinement for species that are farmed for food. Continuing to cage animals for fur production can no longer be justified. 4) A clear majority of EU citizens want to see fur farming banned and, increasingly, more Member States are taking action to eliminate fur production at national level. 5) The co-legislators have expressed their concerns about fur farming. 6) Fur farms pose a risk to animal and human health, as illustrated during the Covid-19 pandemic when hundreds of mink farms were affected by coronavirus outbreaks and new virus variants of SARS-CoV-2 were found to have been transmitted to humans. 7) Fur farming has a significant environmental impact and it poses a serious threat to native biodiversity. 8) A marked divergence between national laws with respect to the fur production sector has led to a distortion in the Union’s internal market, and the only justifiable solution is now to impose an outright ban. 9) The marketing of farmed fur and products containing such fur should not be allowed in the EU.",Answered
