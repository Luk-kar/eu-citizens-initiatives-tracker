Fraternité 2020 - Mobility. Progress. Europe.,2012/000001,"F2020 wants to enhance EU exchange programmes – like Erasmus or the European Voluntary Service (EVS) – in order to contribute to a united Europe based on solidarity among citizens.
               
               F2020 suggests three measures to increase mobility: 1) The Commission shall use existing EU funds more consistently to encourage mobility. Also, it shall promote more funds for exchange programmes in the future. Eventually, 10 percent of the EU budget shall be used on these programmes. 2) Increased efforts shall be made for participants to develop intercultural skills, e.g. by offering language classes and classes about the host country's traditions, history, society etc. 3) Progress in the field of mobility shall be better monitored e.g. through Eurostat or Eurobarometer surveys."
Single Communication Tariff Act,2012/000002,"One unique all-inclusive, monthly flat-rate communication tariff within the boundaries of the European Union

"Water and sanitation are a human right!  Water is a public good, not a commodity!",2012/000003,"We invite the European Commission to propose legislation implementing the human right to water and sanitation as recognised by the United Nations, and promoting the provision of water and sanitation as essential public services for all
               
               The EU legislation should require governments to ensure and to provide all citizens with sufficient and clean drinking water and sanitation.
               



                We urge that:
                





                1. The EU institutions and Member States be obliged to ensure that all inhabitants enjoy the right to water and sanitation.
                


                2. Water supply and management of water resources not be subject to ‘internal market rules’ and that water services are excluded from liberalisation.
                


                3. The EU increases its efforts to achieve universal access to water and sanitation."
EU Directive on Dairy Cow Welfare,2012/000004,"An EU Directive to improve welfare of the EU’s 23m dairy cows, create a level playing field and guarantee minimum standards enable improvements as seen with legislation for pigs and poultry.
               
               We seek to inspire and mobilise European citizens to call for a specific directive that guarantees improved animal welfare for dairy cows. By petitioning the Commission through the ECI, we can convey citizens’ desire for policy change around dairy cow welfare.
               






                Our petition focuses on bringing targeted legislation that covers four key areas of cow’s welfare based on the EU Welfare Quality® principles:
                





                - Good housing
                


                - Good health
                


                - Good feeding
                


                - Appropriate behaviour"
One of us,2012/000005,"Juridical protection of the dignity, the right to life and of the integrity of every human being from conception in the areas of EU competence in which such protection is of particular importance
               
               The human embryo deserves respect to its dignity and integrity. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle case, which defines the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should establish a ban and end the financing of activities which presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid and public health."
Let me vote,2012/000006,"To strengthen the rights listed in article 20§2 TFEU by granting EU citizens residing in another Member State the right to vote in all political elections in their country of residence, on the same conditions as the nationals of that State.
               
               The goal of the initiative is to develop the political dimension of the European project by reinforcing citizens’ awareness that they share a common destiny. It would have the following effects:
               



                - To enhance the concept of European Citizenship;
                


                - To facilitate freedom of movement within the EU;
                


                In addition, it could contribute to remedying the loss of voting rights presently experienced by a significant number of EU citizens who are long-term residents of other Member States."
Stop vivisection,2012/000007,"Proposing an European legislative framework aimed at phasing out animal experiments
               
               Considering clear ethical objections to animal experiments and solid scientific principles that invalidate the “animal model” for predicting human response, we urge the European Commission to abrogate directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and to present a new proposal that does away with animal experimentation and instead makes compulsory the use - in biomedical and toxicological research - of data directly relevant for the human species"
High Quality European Education for All,2012/000008,"Europe’s future depends on Education, how to educate citizens, how they learn. Common education goals reflecting EU basic values should be at the heart of a solution to today’s challenges

Seven principles form the basis of this Directive: Strengthening the sorting of household waste; ban over-packaging, the obligation to use recyclable packaging; banning waste incinerator, and finally the requirement for management and treatment of waste, and technology sectors without environmental impact and health."
Suspension of the EU Climate & Energy Package.,2012/000010,"Suspend the 2009 EU Climate & Energy Package (excluding energy efficiency clauses) and further climate regulations until a climate agreement is signed by major CO2 emitters - China, USA, and India.
               
               1. To stop EU climate policy wasting hundreds of billions of euros on ineffective unilateral action on the climate at a time of economic crisis.
               



                2. To stop carbon leakage - export of jobs and businesses to developing countries without climate legislation.
                


                3. To make fuel and energy cheaper, increase employment and reduce fuel poverty. This will increase social cohesion and reduce social exclusion.
                


                4. To increase energy security by allowing member states to use their own natural energy resources."

End Ecocide in Europe: A Citizens’ Initiative to give the Earth Rights,2012/000012,"We invite the European Commission to adopt legislation to prohibit, prevent and pre-empt Ecocide, the extensive damage, destruction to or loss of ecosystems.
               
               1. Criminalise Ecocide and ensure that natural and legal persons can be held responsible for committing Ecocide according to the principle of superior responsibility.
               



                2. Prohibit and prevent any Ecocide on European territories or maritime territories falling under EU legislation, as well as acts outside the EU committed by EU registered legal persons or EU nationals.

European Initiative for Media Pluralism,2012/000013,"Protecting media pluralism through partial harmonisation of national rules on media ownership and transparency, conflicts of interest with political office and independence of media supervisory bodies
               
               We demand amendments to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (or the endorsement of a new Directive) aiming at introducing harmonised rules with regard to the protection of media pluralism as necessary step towards the correct functioning of the internal market. Such legislation, in accordance with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, will also meet the public interest objective of maintaining a pluralist democratic debate through free exchange of ideas and information in the European Union"
"“30 km/h - making the streets liveable!""",2012/000014,"We suggest a 30km/h (20mph) EU-wide default speed limit for urban/residential areas.
               



                Local authorities may set other speed limits if they can show how environmental and safety needs of the most vulnerable road users are met.
                
                The EU has clear road safety and environmental goals but these are not yet met. A 30km/h (20mph) standard speed limit would help to implement them more efficiently as it has proven successful in reducing injuries and fatalities, noise, air pollution and CO2 emissions, and improving the traffic flow. People can travel with less fear. Environmentally friendlier modes become more attractive.
                


                To meet the subsidiarity principle, the local authorities must have the final decision to set other speed limits on their roads and implement equivalent alternatives to meet the goals"

Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) - Exploring a pathway towards emancipatory welfare conditions in the EU,2013/000001,"Asking the Commission, to encourage cooperation between the Member States (according to Art 156 TFEU) aiming to explore the Unconditional Basic Income (UBI) as a tool to improve their respective social security systems.
               
               In the long run the objective is to offer to each person in the EU the unconditional right as an individual, to having his/her material needs met to ensure a life of dignity as stated by the EU treaties, and to empower participation in society supported by the introduction of the UBI.
               



                In the short term, initiatives such as “pilot‐studies“ (Art 156 TFEU) and examination of different models of UBI (EP resolution 2010/2039(INI) §44) should be promoted by the EU."

                4. Enforce current gender equality legislation
                


                These policies replicate those put in place in 1988 in USA who then doubled the number of female entrepreneurs and increased jobs created. The mandatory element of data collection and procurement policy had the greatest effect."
Teach for Youth -- Upgrade to Erasmus 2.0,2013/000005,"Eliminating educational inequity within the EU by enrolling highly motivated and high-achieving recent EU college graduates and postgraduates to teach for one to two years in urban and rural low-income communities throughout the EU.

DO NOT COUNT EDUCATION SPENDING AS PART OF THE DEFICIT! EDUCATION IS AN INVESTMENT!,2013/000006,"Our proposal is to exclude from the calculation of each country's public spending deficit, that part of Government spending for education that is lower than the last 5-year Eurozone average.
               
               1.Combat inequality by providing equal opportunities for education and training to all young people in Europe. 2.Ensure adequate and appropriate infrastructures and tools for high quality education in Europe in times of crisis. 3.Enhance and safeguard growth, development and democratic institutions; ensure the employability of younger generations through investment in education. 4.

Weed like to talk,2013/000008,"A European solution to a European issue : legalizing cannabis.
               
               The ECI Weed like to talk aims at making the EU adopt a common policy on the control and regulation of cannabis production, use and sale.
               
               There is currently a heterogeneous legal map as regards cannabis policies in the EU. The question of coherence and discrimination is worth asking.
               
               A common policy on the control and regulation of cannabis production, use and sale would:
               
               (a) ensure equality before the law and non-discrimination of all EU citizens;
               
               (b) protect consumers and monitor health security;
               
               (c) end cannabis trafficking.
               
               Let’s leap toward the legalization of cannabis and the harmonization of national legislations across the EU."
European Free Vaping Initiative,2013/000009,"Classification of electronic cigarettes and related products through legislation as general purpose recreational products, and not as medicinal, tobacco or similar products, regardless of nicotine content.
               
               Allow all vapers of Europe to keep on vaping, like vapers in member states where vaping is unregulated do, without inflicting any significant negative impact on the availability and diversity of vaping products. Allow all future vapers to experience the rich culture of vaping that we now enjoy in member states where vaping is not regulated. Allow affected manufacturers and vendors to stay in business, without being crippled or burdened with time and money consuming licensing procedures."
Turn me Off!,2014/000001,"Prohibit the practice of leaving the lights on in shops and offices when unoccupied.
               
               Through this initiative, we seek to:
               



                (1) save energy,
                


                (2) limit light pollution,
                


                (3) stop invasive advertising across the whole of the EU.
                


                Switching the light off when you are not there is common sense. And yet too many shops and offices have their lights on at night or on weekends when they are unoccupied. We would like this to stop.
                


                We are not trying to make our streets completely dark. We do believe in street lighting because it has a purpose - it keeps us safe. We simply want lighting that doesn't have one to disappear."

MOVEUROPE,2014/000003,"Creation of MOVEUROPE CARD. A card reducing transport and accommodation costs on the weekend of May 9th in order to celebrate the European Union in a European city (on an annual rotating basis).

In addition to transport and accommodation, the card would facilitate the access to artistic attractions, performances, public European debates and other cultural events."
An end to front companies in order to secure a fairer Europe,2014/000004,"Introduction in a legal instrument in the company law area, of measures to ensure the transparency of legal persons and legal arrangements.
               
               The infiltration into the legitimate economy of financial flows from criminal sources threatens the stability of the financial sector and the internal market.  To counter this, it is essential that information is available on the actual beneficiaries of legal persons and legal arrangements.  The transparency of legal entities and legal arrangements must therefore be organised in a uniform manner across the EU in a legal instrument in the company law area."
For a socially fair Europe! Encouraging a stronger cooperation between EU Member States to fight poverty in Europe,2014/000005,"Encouraging cooperation between Member States in fighting social exclusion through the common aim of insuring that less than 3% of people live below the poverty line in the EU.
               
               We want the European Commission to be more assertive in forging a genuine 'social Europe' by proposing the following: encouraging  cooperation between EU member states  in fighting social exclusion through the common aim of insuring that less than 3% of people live below the poverty line in the EU.

« On The Wire »,2015/000001,"Strengthening communication privacy between private individuals by law and namely wiretapping of lawyer-client communications. A pre-requisite for the rights of defense.

                We call on the European Commission to ensure fair competition in the different transport modes and to guarantee equal treatment of workers (in respect of the principle of equal pay and working conditions), independently of the country of origin."
STOP PLASTIC IN THE SEA,2015/000003,"Given the worrying impact of plastic waste on the marine environment, we call on the Commission to develop even more ambitious rules on this waste, in order to avoid it getting into the sea.
               
               The European Union has yet to specifically address plastic waste, although it poses numerous environmental challenges. That is why we are calling for ambitious rules to be established in this area. The idea is to promote the use of biodegradable plastics as part of a circular economy and, following the waste hierarchy, to prevent the production of plastic waste at source and encourage recycling in order to eliminate dumping at sea. Exhaustive rules at the start of the process will protect the marine environment at a later stage."

               Since taking power in 2010, Viktor Orbán's government has overseen an increase in antidemocratic, xenophobic measures that run counter to the founding principles of the rule of law. This is liable to undermine the EU project as defined in Article 2 TEU. In addition, the unacceptable treatment of migrants by the Hungarian authorities raises the fear that similar steps may be taken by other Member States where democratic culture is recent and fragile."
"Mum, Dad & Kids - European Citizens' Initiative to protect Marriage and Family",2015/000006,"A horizontally applicable regulation that defines the meaning of marriage and family for EU law: marriage is a union between a man and a woman, and family is based on marriage and/or descent.
               
               The increasing fragmentation of the concepts of ""family"" and ""marriage"" poses a problem for the EU. EU legislation refers to both terms, but the meaning is increasingly unclear, and there are diverging definitions in different EU Directives. This initiative proposes to remedy this situation by adopting a EU-wide definition of both terms that is compatible with the legislation of all Member States. In keeping with Art. 9 of the Fundamental Rights Charter it fully respects the competence of each Member State to legislate on marriage and family."

               Refugees are not allowed to enter a plane, because if the asylum application is rejected, the air carrier will be sanctioned because of the EU Directive 2001/51/EC and article 26, paragraph 2,3 of the Schengen acquis. These regulations are a painful measure against the access of foreigners seeking asylum, because the way to the EU is getting exacerbated/ made impossible, even though these humans are politically persecuted. We demand to revise both regulations."

More than education - Shaping active and responsible citizens,2016/000003,"A set of incentive measures, including support and monitoring, to develop citizenship education in curricula on all levels of formal education throughout Europe, aimed at shaping democratic citizens.
               
               A democratic society relies on the citizens' participation, shared values and capability of critical thinking. The Commission should support member states in their responsibility to enable young people from all backgrounds to develop competencies for participating responsibly in society. To promote cohesion, action should be coordinated throughout the Union, by setting a long-term agenda, creating benchmarks, providing support to states, doing periodic evaluations and sharing best practice."

               Article 20 TFEU states “Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.” The CJEU has also asserted that “Citizenship of the Union is intended to be the fundamental status of nationals of the Member States” and that Article 20 TFEU precludes national measures that deprive citizens of the Union of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of rights conferred by status as citizens of the Union. Thus, facing Brexit, citizenship and nationality must be separated."

               Due to significant wage differences the movement of workers is one-directional. Massive emigration leads to less-favored Member States falling even further behind. Meanwhile, richer Member States experience a massive influx of workers as an intrusion upon their interests, which tears the EU apart. The EU needs to clearly demonstrate its intention to eliminate wage inequalities affecting the free movement of workers in order for which the EU needs a more efficient cohesion to ensure its survival"
Stop Extremism,2017/000007,"We call on the European Commission to draft a bill to prevent and reduce the negative consequences of extremism, particularly on the Single Market.

We want to prevent employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer standards from being lowered and public services (such as water) and cultural assets from being deregulated in non-transparent negotiations. The ECI supports an alternative trade and investment policy in the EU."

                2. No one should be prosecuted or fined for offering humanitarian help or shelter. We want the Commission to stop those governments that are punishing volunteers.
                


                3. Everyone has the right to justice. We want the Commission to guarantee more effective ways and rules to defend all victims of labour exploitation and crime across Europe and all victims of human rights abuses at our borders."

               Vegetarians & vegans struggle across the EU to identify suitable food. We must study the ingredients list of a food product to determine if it is fit for purchase with a hyper-awareness of ambiguous ingredients that could either be plant or animal based. Complicating this further is the fact that the EU does not have a unified language. We then propose laws mandating 1 of 3 simple pictorial labels on all food products: Non-Vegetarian, Vegetarian, or Vegan with all food labelling."

               A steadily increasing price on fossil fuels will reduce pollution. It leads companies and consumers to choose cleaner, cheaper options. All the money collected is returned fairly every month to citizens as a dividend. Most low and middle income families will be better off. A border adjustment protects our economy and drives global adoption. Other benefits include: cleaner air; more jobs and reduced government spending due to policy alignment."

Ending the aviation fuel tax exemption in Europe,2019/000009,"We call the European Commission to propose to member states the introduction of a tax on aviation fuel (kerosene). The aviation sector enjoys tax advantages despite being one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.
               
               While greener alternatives to aviation are subject to high taxes, the aviation industry benefits from many unjust tax exemptions. Aviation fuel remains untaxed in Europe and Member States don’t impose VAT on plane tickets, making aviation a more and more attractive transport mode whereas it is the most carbon-intensive. Taxing kerosene would allow the EU to drastically increase its funding for greener mobility as transport is the fastest growing greenhouse gas emissions sector."

At the same time, the proposal shall abolish the existing system of free allowances to EU polluters and introduce a border adjustment mechanism on non-EU imports, in such a way as to compensate for the lower pricing on CO2 emissions in the exporting country. The higher revenue deriving from carbon pricing shall be allocated to European policies that support energy saving and the use of renewable sources, and to the reduction of taxation on lower incomes."

               On 10 May, the European Union already exceeded the limit of the resources that the planet can provide to it. However, and despite the scientific reports stressing the urgent need to act, Europe is not implementing any profound change in its model. Plastic is symptomatic of this stubborn refusal to face the facts, which is at odds with the needs of the environment. We are therefore calling for the banning of all plastic packaging and bottles by 2027 so that concrete measures can begin to be put in place to respect the limits of our resources."

Under certain conditions, the corruption among political elites in newly acceded countries may turn out to be beneficial to other countries in the Union, and the relative notion ‘temporary’ to be stretched out indefinitely. Setting a strict timeframe avoids direct and indirect motivation for corruption in EU member states. One such example is the inefficiency of the existing monitoring mechanism in the case of Bulgaria and Romania."

                We aim to end the trade of fins in the EU including the import, export and transit of fins other than if naturally attached to the animal’s body.
                


                As finning prevents effective shark conservation measures, we request to extend REGULATION (EU) No 605/2013 also to the trade of fins and therefore ask the commission to develop a new regulation, extending “fins naturally attached” to all trading of sharks and rays in the EU."

Start Unconditional Basic Incomes (UBI) throughout the EU,2020/000003,"Subject Matter:
               


                Our aim is to establish the introduction of unconditional basic incomes throughout the EU which ensure every person’s material existence and opportunity to participate in society as part of its economic policy. This aim shall be reached while remaining within the competences conferred to the EU by the Treaties.
               

                Objectives:
               

                We request the EU Commission to make a proposal for unconditional basic incomes throughout the EU, which reduce regional disparities in order to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU.
               

                This shall realize the aim of the joint statement by the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission, stated in 2017, that “the EU and its member states will also support efficient, sustainable and equitable social protection systems to guarantee basic income” in order to combat inequality."

Right to Cure,2020/000005,"Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in particular articles 114, 118 and 168 thereof, we ask the European Commission to propose all legislation to
               
               - ensure that intellectual property rights, including patents, do not hamper the accessibility or availability of any future Covid-19 vaccine or treatment;
               
               - ensure that EU-legislation on data and market exclusivity does not limit the immediate effectiveness of compulsory licenses issued by Member States;
               
               - introduce legal obligations for beneficiaries from EU-funds to share COVID-19 health technology related knowledge, intellectual property and/or data in a technology or patent pool;

Civil society initiative for a ban on biometric mass surveillance practices,2021/000001,"We call on the European Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric technologies in order to avoid undue interference with fundamental rights.
               
               In particular, we ask the Commission to prohibit, in law and in practice, indiscriminate or arbitrarily-targeted uses of biometrics which can lead to unlawful mass surveillance. These intrusive systems must not be developed, deployed (even on a trial basis) or used by public or private entities insofar as they can lead to unnecessary or disproportionate interference with people’s fundamental rights.
               
               Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest and not to be discriminated against. The widespread use of biometric surveillance, profiling and prediction is a threat to the rule of law and our most basic freedoms.

Civil Servant Exchange Program (CSEP),2021/000002,"As European students and future civil servants, we believe that exchanges should not stop once studies come to an end.
               




                We therefore propose the creation of a Civil Servant Exchange Program (CSEP), an exchange and training programme between civil servants of the Member States of the European Union. The aim of this ‘Erasmus for the civil service’ would be to offer civil servants from EU Member States professional experience in a similar service in another Member State for a period of 2 to 12 months. During the exchange, civil servants could continue to receive the salary of their home country, subject to compensation from the EU if this salary is lower than that received in the host country for an equivalent position.
               

                The CSEP would strengthen the freedom of movement of workers in the EU, foster an exchange of best practices between civil services and improve links between Member States. In addition, the CSEP would help civil servants to overcome the numerous challenges they encounter in their working relations with t"
Green Garden Roof Tops,2021/000003,"In Europe there are many existing stores with an empty rooftop; in most of the cases these rooftops are not being used for any specific purpose. In addition, these rooftops are full of plastic and stones, materials of which the roof is made of. Therefore, these areas are in itself not contributing to the benefits of the environment, rather they are simply increasing the environmental damages. The reason of focusing on the environmental benefits, is stemming from our current time environmental crisis. We need to rethink and find ways to increase the awareness of environmental problems and how to bring our society, the economy and the protection of our planet in a healthy balance. Therefore, the core of the plan is to utilize the existing spaces found on rooftops.  The idea is to create on different corporations’ rooftops a green garden area. In this way the unutilized roofs, could be transformed in means able of improving and aiding the environmental crisis."
Ban Fossil Fuel Advertising and Sponsorships,2021/000004,"We call on the European Commission to propose an EU legislative act: prohibiting advertisements for fossil fuels, as well as air, road and water-borne transportation (other than transport services of general economic interest) powered by fossil fuels; prohibiting advertisements  from any undertakings active in the market for fossil fuels, in particular by extracting, refining, supplying, distributing or selling fossil fuels; prohibiting sponsorships by undertakings defined under point 2 above, or using trademarks or commercial names used for fossil fuels. This law would fall into the EU competence, in that it would consist in an internal market regulation aimed at enhancing consumer protection, as well as a high level of public health and environmental protection. Indeed, this legislation would increase public awareness of products and technologies that are responsible for climate change and other environmental and health harms. As such, it would pursue objectives that are envisaged by the EU environmental and consumer protection policies, via the harmonisation of rules on fossil fue"

SAVE CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS - COMMIT TO A EUROPE WITHOUT ANIMAL TESTING,2021/000006,"With the EU ban on cosmetics tests on animals came the promise of a Europe in which animals no longer suffer and die for the sake of cosmetics. That promise has been broken. Authorities still demand animal tests on ingredients used in cosmetics, which goes against the expectations and wishes of the public and the intention of legislators.
               




                Yet, never have we had such powerful non-animal tools for assuring safety or such a golden opportunity to revolutionise human and environmental protection. The European Commission must uphold and strengthen the ban and transition to animal-free safety assessment.
               



                We call on the European Commission to do the following:

Ensuring Common Commercial Policy conformity with EU Treaties and compliance with international law,2021/000008,"We seek to regulate commercial transactions with Occupant’s entities based or operating in occupied territories by withholding products originating from there from entering the EU market. The Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties, has to ensure consistency of Union’s policy and compliance with fundamental rights and international law in all areas of EU law, including CCP. It must propose legal acts based on the Common Commercial Policy to prevent EU legal entities from both importing products originating in illegal settlements in occupied territories and exporting to such territories, in order to preserve the integrity of the internal market and to not aid or assist the maintenance of such unlawful situations. The initiative thus invites the Commission to submit a proposal for a legal act under the Common Commercial Policy which is general in nature and does not target a specific country or territory."

Fur Free Europe,2022/000002,"Fur farming is inherently cruel and it is widely rejected by EU citizens.
               

               It is impossible to improve the welfare of animals on fur farms. Whilst no animals should live in a caged environment, the keeping of inherently wild species in cages can only be defined as abject cruelty.
               

               The keeping and killing of animals solely for the purpose of fur production is ethically unacceptable.

'I'm Going European':  An ECI to Connect your National and European Citizenship,2023/000010,"This ECI demands a right for everyone, and not just the few, to have a basic knowledge about the EU and their European Citizenship from an early age. Being an active European citizen should be for everyone living in the EU. Only an inclusive approach will make European citizenship a real democratic citizenship. This is consistent with repeated resolutions of the European Parliament and recommendations from the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFoE).
               

                We ask the Commission to:

                . The European Environment Authority would be an independent, central EU environment authority with legal personality, which, for the effective functioning of the internal market, alongside the Member States’ national environment authorities, would take administrative decisions that are binding on Member States and natural and legal persons, i.e. businesses having their registered office or ownership in either the EU or a third country, whenever the environmental impact of Member States’ agricultural, industrial or service activities – at any stage of those activities, including waste management and recycling – extends beyond national borders and occurs at EU level.

Ban on conversion practices in the European Union,2024/000001,"We call on the European Commission to propose a binding legal ban on conversion practices targeting LGBTQ+ citizens in the European Union:
               

                Conversion Practices are interventions aimed at changing, repressing or suppressing the sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression of LGBTQ+ persons.
               

                Such practices, due to their discriminatory, degrading, harmful and fraudulent nature have been qualified as torture by the United Nations, and are currently being banned in a growing number of States.
               

                The EU plays a key role in the protection of fundamental rights and should take actions to fight against all inhuman practices. The Commission should propose a directive adding conversion practices to the list of euro-crimes and/or amend the ongoing directive on equality (2008) to include a ban on these practices.
               

                Furthermore, to fight against the legislative moratorium, the Commission should also enforce a non-binding resolution calling for a widespread "

"My Voice, My Choice: For Safe And Accessible Abortion",2024/000004,"The “My Voice, My Choice” campaign offers the people of Europe the chance to make women's lives freer, safer, and better; wherever they live in our union, whatever conditions they may find themselves in.
               


                 The lack of access to abortion in many parts of Europe not only puts women at risk of physical harm but also puts undue economic and mental stress on women and families, often on the margins of society that can afford it the least.
                


                It has been well documented that treating reproductive care as a luxury does not reduce abortions, it simply drives women to seek unsafe abortions.
               


                 To change this we are asking the European Commission to - in the spirit of solidarity - submit a proposal for financial support to Member States that would be able to perform safe termination of pregnancies for anyone in Europe who still lacks access to safe and legal abortion.

Air-Quotas,2024/000006,"We, citizens of Europe, who have become aware of the climate danger at the heart of the sixth extinction that is under way, call on the European Commission to set up a climate assembly leading to a citizens’ carbon quota mechanism in each country that will encourage businesses to decarbonise through consumer demand.
               

                The mechanism should cover all purchases of goods and services. It starts symbolically with a critical means of transport, air transport. The Air Quotas information campaign makes it possible to understand the trade mechanism between carbon deficits and surpluses based on a fair distribution that decreases from year to year in line with the Paris Agreement and the European Union’s announcement of a 55% reduction.
               

                The three phases of the climate assembly are a survey, formulation by citizens selected by lot, together with experts and elected representatives, and finally national referendums for implementation in each country. The initial focus on air transport, leading to a media campaign, could be used as a"
Stop Destroying Videogames,2024/000007,"This initiative calls to require publishers that sell or license videogames to consumers in the European Union (or related features and assets sold for videogames they operate) to leave said videogames in a functional (playable) state.
               

                Specifically, the initiative seeks to prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.
               

                The initiative does not seek to acquire ownership of said videogames, associated intellectual rights or monetization rights, neither does it expect the publisher to provide resources for the said videogame once they discontinue it while leaving it in a reasonably functional (playable) state."

Because the demolition of existing buildings is as outdated as food waste, animal testing, fast fashion and single-use plastics.
               

                In order to achieve these objectives, we demand a right to reuse for existing buildings based on three key pillars: (I) tax reductions for renovation works and reused materials, (II) fair rules to assess both potentials and risks of existing buildings, and (III) new values for the embedded CO2 in existing structures."

Industrial food systems aggravate food insecurity, climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, labour exploitation and animal suffering.

"Save your right, save your flight!",2025/000003,"The Council is trying to push through devastating changes to passenger rights that will water down protections travellers have relied on for two decades.
               

                What We're Losing:
               

                Time – Under the current proposal, compensation will only be granted after delays of at least 4 hours up from at least 2 hours.
               

                Money – Compensations are being slashed by €100 for medium and long-haul flights, despite the rising delays and travel costs.
               

                Rights – Protections under current law are being reduced. Rolling back existing rights sets a dangerous precedent.
               

                The Reality:
               

                Most flight delays are under 4 hours, meaning that passengers will now lose their right to compensation. Those who qualify will receive less money. Airlines lobbied hard for these changes, but travellers will pay the price through worse service and less recourse.
