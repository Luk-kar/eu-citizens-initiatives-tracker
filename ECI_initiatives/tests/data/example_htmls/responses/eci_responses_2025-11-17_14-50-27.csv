Main conclusions of the Communication:
While the Commission does share the conviction that animal testing should be phased out in Europe, its approach for achieving that objective differs from the one proposed in this Citizens' Initiative.
The Commission considers that the Directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (Directive 2010/63/EU), which the Initiative seeks to repeal, is the right legislation to achieve the underlying objectives of the Initiative. It sets full replacement of animals as its ultimate goal as soon as it is scientifically possibly, and provides a legally binding stepwise approach as non-animal alternatives become available. Therefore, no repeal of that legislation was proposed.
Moreover, the Communication sets out four further Commission’s actions to be taken towards the goal of phasing out animal testing. These actions included a scientific conference engaging the scientific community and relevant stakeholders in a debate on how to exploit the advances in science for the development of scientifically valid non-animal approaches.
The Commission commits to active monitoring of compliance and enforcement of the legislation, and will continue supporting the development and validation of alternative approaches to the use of animals in research and testing. Dialogue with all stakeholders will continue, especially with the scientific community, to advance towards the goal of phasing out animal testing through knowledge sharing, dissemination, and education and training activities on non-animal alternatives and the Three Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animal use in testing).",Rejected - Alternative Actions,,False,,True,"While the Commission does share the conviction that animal testing should be phased out in Europe, its approach for achieving that objective differs from the one proposed in this Citizens' Initiative.

On the first aim, to 'ban glyphosate-based herbicides', the Commission concluded that there are neither scientific nor legal grounds to justify a ban of glyphosate, and will not make a legislative proposal to that effect.

See details below under ‘Follow-up’.
On the third aim, to 'set EU-wide mandatory reduction targets for pesticide use, with a view to achieving a pesticide-free future', the Commission concluded that it intends to focus on the implementation of the [Sustainable Use Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/sustainable_use_pesticides_en) Sustainable Use Directive , and will re-evaluate the situation, initially in a report to Council and the Parliament on the implementation of the Directive to be produced in 2019.

The Commission carefully analysed the citizens' proposals and concluded that while some proposals fall outside of EU competence, as they would interfere with the existing constitutional setup of the concerned Member States, others are already covered under the current Cohesion policy thanks to its robust safeguards promoting inclusion and equal treatment of minorities, as well as the respect for cultural and linguistic diversity.
Consequently, no new legislation will be proposed in response to this ECI. However, the Commission will continue to ensure non-discriminatory access to Union funding and to monitor as well as support Member States' actions to guarantee equal treatment in the implementation of Cohesion policy.
For the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the Commission has proposed a strengthened and modernised cohesion and growth policy that ensures adequate mechanisms are in place in Member States to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights throughout the implementation of the national and regional partnership plans, as well as respect for the principles of the rule of law.

Protect and strengthen the cosmetics animal testing ban:The EU Cosmetics Regulation already prohibits the placing on the market of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals, but this ban does not extend to safety tests required to assess risks from chemicals to workers and the environment under the EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). The interface between the two pieces of legislation is currently being assessed in two casesbefore the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Commission will consider the outcome of the court cases in view ofany future potential legislative changes.Transform EU chemicals legislation:The Commission will work together with all relevant parties on a roadmap towards chemical safety assessments that are free from animal testing. The roadmap will serve as a guiding framework for future actions and initiatives aimed at reducing and ultimately eliminating animal testing in the context of chemicals legislation within the European Union.Modernise science in the EU:The Commission will continue to strongly support  the development of alternative approaches with appropriate funding. It will also initiate a series of actions to accelerate the reduction of animal testing in research, education and training.",Action Plan Created,,False,,False,,,"[

The Commission has tasked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to provide a scientific opinion on the welfare of animals farmed for fur.
Building further on this scientific input, and on an assessment of economic and social impacts, the Commission will then communicate, by March 2026, on the most appropriate action.
