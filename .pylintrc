# Disable logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203):
# - F-strings provide better code readability
# - Performance overhead from eager evaluation is negligible for our logging volume
#
# Disable no-else-return (R1705):
# - Developer disagrees that else/elif after return is unnecessary
# - Explicit else blocks improve code readability and intent clarity
# - Makes it obvious that all cases are covered (exhaustive conditionals)
# - Prevents bugs where code runs unexpectedly without a clear else statement
