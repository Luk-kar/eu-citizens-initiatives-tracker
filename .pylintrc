[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203):
# - F-strings provide better code readability
# - Performance overhead from eager evaluation is negligible for our logging volume
#
# Disable no-else-return (R1705):
# - Developer disagrees that else/elif after return is unnecessary
# - Explicit else blocks improve code readability and intent clarity
# - Makes it obvious that all cases are covered (exhaustive conditionals)
# - Prevents bugs where code runs unexpectedly without a clear else statement
#
# Disable no-else-break (R1723):
# - Developer disagrees that else/elif after break is unnecessary
# - similar reasons like in no-else-return case (R1705)
#
# # Disable invalid-name (C0103):
# - Produces false positives by treating all module-level variables as constants
